Vows and oaths must be kept—Fathers may disallow vows of daughters, and husbands may disallow vows of wives.

###### 1 
And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This  the thing which the  hath commanded.

###### 2 
If a man vow a vow unto the , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

###### 3 
If a woman also vow a vow unto the , and bind  by a bond,  in her father’s house in her youth;

###### 4 
And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

###### 5 
But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the  shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

###### 6 
And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

###### 7 
And her husband heard  and held his peace at her in the day that he heard  then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

###### 8 
But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard  then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the  shall forgive her.

###### 9 
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

###### 10 
And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;

###### 11 
And her husband heard  and held his peace at her,  disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

###### 12 
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard  whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the  shall forgive her.

###### 13 
Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

###### 14 
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which  upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard 

###### 15 
But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard  then he shall bear her iniquity.

###### 16 
These  the statutes, which the  commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter,  in her youth in her father’s house.
