###### 11 
Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.

And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever  among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the ; as ye do, so he shall do.

###### 15 
One ordinance  for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth  an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye  so shall the stranger be before the .

###### 16 
One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.

###### 17 
And the  spake unto Moses, saying,

###### 18 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,

###### 19 
Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the .

###### 22

###### 23 
 all that the  hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the  commanded  and henceforward among your generations;

###### 24 
Then it shall be, if  be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the , with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

###### 25 
And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it  ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the , and their sin offering before the , for their ignorance:

###### 26 
And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people  in ignorance.

###### 27

And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the , to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

###### 29 
Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,  him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

###### 30 
But the soul that doeth  presumptuously,  born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

###### 31 
Because he hath despised the word of the , and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity  upon him.

###### 32

###### 36

###### 37 
And the  spake unto Moses, saying,

###### 38 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

###### 39 
And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the , and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

###### 40 
That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.

###### 41 
I  the  your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I  the  your God.
