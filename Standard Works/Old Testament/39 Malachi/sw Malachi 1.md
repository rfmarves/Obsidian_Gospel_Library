__Summary__
The Jews despise the Lord by offering polluted bread upon the altar and by sacrificing animals with blemishes—The Lord’s name will be great among the Gentiles.

###### 1 
The burden of the word of the  to Israel by Malachi.

###### 2 
I have loved you, saith the . Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?  not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the : yet I loved Jacob,

###### 3 
And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

###### 4 
Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the  of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the  hath indignation for ever.

###### 5 
And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The  will be magnified from the border of Israel.

###### 6 
A son honoureth  father, and a servant his master: if then I  a father, where  mine honour? and if I  a master, where  my fear? saith the  of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?

###### 7 
Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the   contemptible.

###### 8 
And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,  not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick,  not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the  of hosts.

###### 9 
And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the  of hosts.

###### 10 
Who  even among you that would shut the doors  neither do ye kindle  on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the  of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.

###### 11 
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name  great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense  offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name  great among the heathen, saith the  of hosts.

###### 12 
But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the   polluted; and the fruit thereof,  his meat,  contemptible.

###### 13 
Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness  and ye have snuffed at it, saith the  of hosts; and ye brought  torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the .

###### 14 
But cursed  the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I  a great King, saith the  of hosts, and my name  dreadful among the heathen.
