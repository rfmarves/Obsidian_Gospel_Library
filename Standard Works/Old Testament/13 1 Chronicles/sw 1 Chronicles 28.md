Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the , and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the  your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave  for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.

###### 10 
Take heed now; for the  hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do

Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the , and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:

All  the  made me understand in writing by  hand upon me,  all the works of this pattern.

And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do  fear not, nor be dismayed: for the  God,  my God,  with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the .

###### 21
