> __Summary__
Nathan first approves David’s building of a house of the Lord, then restrains him—David’s son will build the temple—The triumph of Israel is foretold—David thanks the Lord for His goodness to Israel.

###### 1 
Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the   under curtains.

###### 2 
Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that  in thine heart; for God  with thee.

###### 3 
And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,

###### 4 
Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the , Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:

###### 5 
For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from  tabernacle 

###### 6 
Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

###### 7 
Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the  of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote,  from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:

###### 8 
And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that  in the earth.

###### 9 
Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,

###### 10 
And since the time that I commanded judges  over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the  will build thee an house.

###### 11 
And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go  with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

###### 12 
He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.

###### 13 
I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took  from  that was before thee:

###### 14 
But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

###### 15 
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

###### 16 
And David the king came and sat before the , and said, Who  I, O  God, and what  mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

###### 17 
And  this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast  spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O  God.

###### 18 
What can David  more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

###### 19 
O , for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all  great things.

###### 20 
O ,  none like thee, neither  God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

###### 21 
And what one nation in the earth  like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem  his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

###### 22 
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, , becamest their God.

###### 23 
Therefore now, , let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

###### 24 
Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The  of hosts  the God of Israel,  a God to Israel: and  the house of David thy servant  established before thee.

###### 25 
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found  to pray before thee.

###### 26 
And now, , thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

###### 27 
Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O , and  blessed for ever.
