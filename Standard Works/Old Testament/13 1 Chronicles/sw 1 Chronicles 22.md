And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;

Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

###### 5 
And David said, Solomon my son  young and tender, and the house  to be builded for the   exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will  now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

###### 6 
Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the  God of Israel.

###### 7 
And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the  my God:

###### 8 
But the word of the  came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.

###### 9 
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

###### 10 
He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I  his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

###### 11 
Now, my son, the  be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the  thy God, as he hath said of thee.

###### 12 
Only the  give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the  thy God.

###### 13 
Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the  charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

###### 14 
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the  an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

###### 15 
Moreover  workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.

###### 16 
Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron,  no number. Arise  and be doing, and the  be with thee.

###### 17 
David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, 

###### 18 
 not the  your God with you? and hath he  given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the , and before his people.

###### 19 
Now set your heart and your soul to seek the  your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the  God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the , and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the .
