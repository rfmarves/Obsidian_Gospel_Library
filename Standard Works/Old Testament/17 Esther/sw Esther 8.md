__Summary__

###### 1 
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he  unto her.

###### 2 
And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.

###### 3

###### 4

###### 5 
And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing  right before the king, and I  pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which  in all the king’s provinces:

###### 6 
For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?

###### 7 
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.

###### 8 
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal  with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.

###### 9

###### 10 
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed  with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback,  riders on mules, camels,  young dromedaries:

###### 11 
Wherein the king granted the Jews which  in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them,  little ones and women, and  the spoil of them for a prey,

###### 12 
Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus,  upon the thirteenth  of the twelfth month, which  the month Adar.

###### 13 
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province  published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

###### 14

###### 15

###### 17
