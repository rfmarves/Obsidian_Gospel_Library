###### 1 
Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the  in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth  of the first month.

###### 3 
And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the , Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build;  not  a burden upon  shoulders: serve now the  your God, and his people Israel,

###### 4 
And prepare  by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

###### 5 
And stand in the holy  according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and  the division of the families of the Levites.

###### 6 
So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that  may do according to the word of the  by the hand of Moses.

###### 7 
And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these  of the king’s substance.

###### 8 
And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred  and three hundred oxen.

###### 9 
Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand  and five hundred oxen.

###### 10 
So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.

###### 11 
And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled  from their hands, and the Levites flayed 

###### 12 
And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the , as  written in the book of Moses. And so  with the oxen.

###### 13 
And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the  holy  sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided  speedily among all the people.

###### 14 
And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron  in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.

###### 15 
And the singers the sons of Asaph  in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters  at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.

###### 16 
So all the service of the  was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the , according to the commandment of king Josiah.

###### 17 
And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

###### 18 
And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

###### 19 
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.

###### 20 
After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

###### 21 
But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?  not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from  God, who  with me, that he destroy thee not.

###### 22 
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.

###### 23 
And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

###### 24 
His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in  the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

###### 25 
And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they  written in the lamentations.

###### 26 
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to  written in the law of the ,

###### 27 
And his deeds, first and last, behold, they  written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
