> __Summary__
Hoshea reigns in Israel and is subject to the Assyrians—The Israelites forsake the Lord, worship idols, serve Baal, and reject all that the Lord has given them—The ten tribes are carried away captive by the kings of Assyria—The land of Israel (Samaria) is repopulated by other people—Many forms of false worship are found among the Samaritans.

###### 1 
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

###### 2 
And he did  evil in the sight of the , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

###### 3 
Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.

###### 4 
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as  year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

###### 5 
Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

###### 6 
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor  the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

###### 7 
For  it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the  their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,

###### 8 
And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the  cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.

###### 9 
And the children of Israel did secretly  things that  not right against the  their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

###### 10 
And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:

###### 11 
And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as  the heathen whom the  carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the  to anger:

###### 12 
For they served idols, whereof the  had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.

###### 13 
Yet the  testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets,  all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments  my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

###### 14 
Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the  their God.

###### 15 
And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that  round about them,  whom the  had charged them, that they should not do like them.

###### 16 
And they left all the commandments of the  their God, and made them molten images,  two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

###### 17 
And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the , to provoke him to anger.

###### 18 
Therefore the  was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

###### 19 
Also Judah kept not the commandments of the  their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

###### 20 
And the  rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.

###### 21 
For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the , and made them sin a great sin.

###### 22 
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;

###### 23 
Until the  removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

###### 24 
And the king of Assyria brought  from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed  in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.

###### 25 
And  it was at the beginning of their dwelling there,  they feared not the : therefore the  sent lions among them, which slew  of them.

###### 26 
Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

###### 27 
Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.

###### 28 
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the .

###### 29 
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put  in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

###### 30 
And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

###### 31 
And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

###### 32 
So they feared the , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.

###### 33 
They feared the , and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

###### 34 
Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the , neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the  commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

###### 35 
With whom the  had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

###### 36 
But the , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

###### 37 
And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

###### 38 
And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

###### 39 
But the  your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.

###### 40 
Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.

###### 41 
So these nations feared the , and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
