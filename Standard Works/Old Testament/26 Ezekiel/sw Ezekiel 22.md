Ezekiel catalogs the sins of the people of Judah in Jerusalem—They will be scattered and destroyed for their iniquities.

###### 1 
Moreover the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 2 
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

###### 3 
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord , The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.

###### 4 
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come  unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

###### 5 
 near, and  far from thee, shall mock thee,  infamous  much vexed.

###### 6 
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.

###### 7 
In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

###### 8 
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.

###### 9 
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.

###### 10 
In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

###### 11 
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.

###### 12 
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord .

###### 13 
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.

###### 14 
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the  have spoken  and will do 

###### 15 
And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

###### 16 
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I  the .

###### 17 
And the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 18 
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they  brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are  the dross of silver.

###### 19 
Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

###### 20 
 they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt  so will I gather  in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave  and melt you.

###### 21 
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.

###### 22 
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the  have poured out my fury upon you.

###### 23 
And the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 24 
Son of man, say unto her, Thou  the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

###### 25 
 a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

###### 26 
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed  between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

###### 27 
Her princes in the midst thereof  like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood,  to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.

###### 28 
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered  seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord , when the  hath not spoken.

###### 29 
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

###### 30 
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.

###### 31 
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord .
