So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;

###### 14 
Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

###### 15 
And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which  behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

###### 16 
The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows  covered;

From the ground unto above the door  cherubims and palm trees made, and  the wall of the temple.
