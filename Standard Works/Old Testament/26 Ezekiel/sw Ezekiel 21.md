__Summary__
Both the righteous and the wicked in Jerusalem will be slainâ€”Babylon will draw a sharp and bright sword against Israel and will prevail.

---
###### 1 
And the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 2 
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop  toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,

###### 3 
And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the ; Behold, I  against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.

###### 4 
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

###### 5 
That all flesh may know that I the  have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

###### 6 
Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of  loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

###### 7 
And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak  water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord .

###### 8 
Again the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 9 
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the ; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

###### 10 
It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son,  every tree.

###### 11 
And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.

###### 12 
Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it  upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon  thigh.

###### 13 
Because  a trial, and what if  contemn even the rod? it shall be no  saith the Lord .

###### 14 
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite  hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it  the sword of the great  slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.

###### 15 
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that  heart may faint, and  ruins be multiplied: ah!  made bright,  wrapped up for the slaughter.

###### 16 
Go thee one way or other,  on the right hand,  on the left, whithersoever thy face  set.

###### 17 
I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the  have said 

###### 18 
The word of the  came unto me again, saying,

###### 19 
Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose  at the head of the way to the city.

###### 20 
Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

###### 21 
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made  arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.

###### 22 
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint  rams against the gates, to cast a mount,  to build a fort.

###### 23 
And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

###### 24 
Therefore thus saith the Lord ; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because,  that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.

###### 25 
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity  an end,

###### 26 
Thus saith the Lord ; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this  not  the same: exalt  low, and abase  high.

###### 27 
I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no  until he come whose right it is; and I will give it 

###### 28 
And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord  concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword  drawn: for the slaughter  furbished, to consume because of the glittering:

###### 29 
Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of  slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity  an end.

###### 30 
Shall I cause  to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.

###### 31 
And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men,  skilful to destroy.

###### 32 
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no  remembered: for I the  have spoken
