###### 4 
Thy borders  in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

###### 5 
They have made all thy  boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

###### 6 
 the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches  ivory,  out of the isles of Chittim.

###### 7 
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.

###### 8 
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise  O Tyrus,  were in thee, were thy pilots.

###### 9 
The ancients of Gebal and the wise  thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.

###### 11 
The men of Arvad with thine army  upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.

Tarshish  thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all  riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.

###### 14 
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.

###### 15 
The men of Dedan  thy merchants; many isles  the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee  a present horns of ivory and ebony.

###### 16 
Syria  thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.

###### 17 
Judah, and the land of Israel, they  thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.

###### 18 
Damascus  thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.

These  thy merchants in all sorts  in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

###### 25 
The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.

###### 26 
Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

###### 27 
Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that  in thee, and in all thy company which  in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

###### 28 
The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

###### 29 
And all that handle the oar, the mariners,  all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;

###### 30 
And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

###### 31 
And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart  bitter wailing.

###### 32 
And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee,  What  like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

###### 33 
When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

###### 34 
In the time  thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.

###### 35 
All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in  countenance.

###### 36 
The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never  any more.
