__Summary__
Ezekiel is called to take the word of the Lord to Israelâ€”He sees a book in which lamentations and mourning are written.

---
###### 1 
And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.

###### 2 
And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

###### 3 
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me,  unto this very day.

###### 4 
For  impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord .

###### 5 
And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they  a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.

###### 6 
And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns  with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they  a rebellious house.

###### 7 
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they  most rebellious.

###### 8 
But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.

###### 9 
And when I looked, behold, an hand  sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book  therein;

###### 10 
And he spread it before me; and it  written within and without: and  written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
