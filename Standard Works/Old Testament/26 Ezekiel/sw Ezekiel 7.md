###### 1 
Moreover the word of the  came unto me, saying,

###### 2 
Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord  unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.

###### 3 
Now  the end  upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

###### 4 
And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I  the .

###### 5 
Thus saith the Lord ; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.

###### 6 
An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.

###### 7 
The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble  near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.

###### 8 
Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

###### 9 
And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations  are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I  the  that smiteth.

###### 10 
Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

###### 11 
Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them  nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither  wailing for them.

###### 12 
The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath  upon all the multitude thereof.

###### 13 
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision  touching the whole multitude thereof,  shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

###### 14 
They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath  upon all the multitude thereof.

###### 15 
The sword  without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that  in the field shall die with the sword; and he that  in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.

###### 16 
But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.

###### 17 
All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak  water.

###### 18 
They shall also gird  with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame  upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.

###### 19 
They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the : they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

###### 20 
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations  of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.

###### 21 
And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.

###### 22 
My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret  for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.

###### 23 
Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

###### 24 
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

###### 25 
Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and  none.

###### 26 
Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.

###### 27 
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I  the .
