###### 4 
But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.

Yet thus saith the Lord ; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:

And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return  the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.
