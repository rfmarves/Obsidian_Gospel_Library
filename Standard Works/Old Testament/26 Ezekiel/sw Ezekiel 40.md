> __Summary__
A heavenly messenger shows Ezekiel in vision a city where the temple is located—Ezekiel is shown the form and size of the temple and its courts.

###### 1 
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth  of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the  was upon me, and brought me thither.

###### 2 
In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which  as the frame of a city on the south.

###### 3 
And he brought me thither, and, behold,  a man, whose appearance  like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.

###### 4 
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew  unto thee  thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.

###### 5 
And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits  by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

###### 6 
Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,  one reed broad; and the other threshold  one reed broad.

###### 7 
And  little chamber  one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers  five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within  one reed.

###### 8 
He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

###### 9 
Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate  inward.

###### 10 
And the little chambers of the gate eastward  three on this side, and three on that side; they three  of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.

###### 11 
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;  the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

###### 12 
The space also before the little chambers  one cubit  and the space  one cubit on that side: and the little chambers  six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.

###### 13 
He measured then the gate from the roof of  little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth  five and twenty cubits, door against door.

###### 14 
He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.

###### 15 
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate  fifty cubits.

###### 16 
And  narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows  round about inward: and upon  post  palm trees.

###### 17 
Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo,  chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers  upon the pavement.

###### 18 
And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates  the lower pavement.

###### 19 
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.

###### 20 
And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.

###### 21 
And the little chambers thereof  three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

###### 22 
And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,  after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof  before them.

###### 23 
And the gate of the inner court  over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.

###### 24 
After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.

###### 25 
And  windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

###### 26 
And  seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof  before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

###### 27 
And  a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.

###### 28 
And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;

###### 29 
And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and  windows in it and in the arches thereof round about:  fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

###### 30 
And the arches round about  five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.

###### 31 
And the arches thereof  toward the utter court; and palm trees  upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it  eight steps.

###### 32 
And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.

###### 33 
And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof,  according to these measures: and  windows therein and in the arches thereof round about:  fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

###### 34 
And the arches thereof  toward the outward court; and palm trees  upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it  eight steps.

###### 35 
And he brought me to the north gate, and measured  according to these measures;

###### 36 
The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

###### 37 
And the posts thereof  toward the utter court; and palm trees  upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it  eight steps.

###### 38 
And the chambers and the entries thereof  by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

###### 39 
And in the porch of the gate  two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

###### 40 
And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate,  two tables; and on the other side, which  at the porch of the gate,  two tables.

###### 41 
Four tables  on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew 

###### 42 
And the four tables  of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

###### 43 
And within  hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables  the flesh of the offering.

###### 44 
And without the inner gate  the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which  at the side of the north gate; and their prospect  toward the south: one at the side of the east gate  the prospect toward the north.

###### 45 
And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect  toward the south,  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.

###### 46 
And the chamber whose prospect  toward the north  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these  the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the  to minister unto him.

###### 47 
So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar  before the house.

###### 48 
And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured  post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate  three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.

###### 49 
The length of the porch  twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and  by the steps whereby they went up to it: and  pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
