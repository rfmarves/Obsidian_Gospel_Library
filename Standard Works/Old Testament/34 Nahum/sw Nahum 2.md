__Summary__
Nineveh will be destroyed, which is a symbol of what will be in the latter days.

---
###### 1 
He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make  loins strong, fortify  power mightily.

###### 2 
For the  hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.

###### 3 
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men  in scarlet: the chariots  with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.

###### 4 
The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

###### 5 
He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.

###### 6 
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.

###### 7 
And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead  as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.

###### 8 
But Nineveh  of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand,  but none shall look back.

###### 9 
Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for  none end of the store  glory out of all the pleasant furniture.

###### 10 
She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain  in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.

###### 11 
Where  the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion,  the old lion, walked,  the lionâ€™s whelp, and none made  afraid?

###### 12 
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.

###### 13 
Behold, I  against thee, saith the  of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
