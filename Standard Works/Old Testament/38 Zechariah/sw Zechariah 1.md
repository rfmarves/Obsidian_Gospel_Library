Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the  of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and  your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the .

###### 5 
Your fathers, where  they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?

###### 6
