###### 2 
When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the ,

###### 3 
 to speak unto the priests which  in the house of the  of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?

###### 4 
Then came the word of the  of hosts unto me, saying,

###### 5 
Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh  even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,  to me?

###### 6 
And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat  and drink

And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.

###### 11 
But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

###### 12 
Yea, they made their hearts  an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the  of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the  of hosts.

###### 13 
Therefore it is come to pass,  as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the  of hosts:

###### 14 
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
