> __Summary__
The Jews will gain forgiveness at the Second Coming—They will ask the Lord, What are these wounds in Thine hands?—The remnant, tried and refined, will be His people.

###### 1 
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

###### 2 
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the  of hosts,  I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

###### 3 
And it shall come to pass,  when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the : and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

###### 4 
And it shall come to pass in that day,  the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

###### 5 
But he shall say, I  no prophet, I  an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

###### 6 
And  shall say unto him, What  these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer,  with which I was wounded  the house of my friends.

###### 7 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man  my fellow, saith the  of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.

###### 8 
And it shall come to pass,  in all the land, saith the , two parts therein shall be cut off  die; but the third shall be left therein.

###### 9 
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It  my people: and they shall say, The   my God.
