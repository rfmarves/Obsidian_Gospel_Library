> __Summary__
Hosea calls Israel to return and serve the Lordâ€”The mercy and knowledge of God are more important than ritualistic sacrifices.

###### 1 
Come, and let us return unto the : for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

###### 2 
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

###### 3 
Then shall we know,  we follow on to know the : his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter  former rain unto the earth.

###### 4 
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness  as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.

###### 5 
Therefore have I hewed  by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments  the light  goeth forth.

###### 6 
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

###### 7 
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.

###### 8 
Gilead  a city of them that work iniquity,  polluted with blood.

###### 9 
And as troops of robbers wait for a man,  the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.

###### 10 
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there  the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

###### 11 
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
