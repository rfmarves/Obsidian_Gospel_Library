O Israel, return unto the  thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.

###### 2 
Take with you words, and turn to the : say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive  graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.

###### 3 
Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands,  our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

###### 4 
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.

###### 6

###### 7 
They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive  the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof  as the wine of Lebanon.

Ephraim  What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard  and observed him: I  like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.

###### 9 
Who  wise, and he shall understand these  prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the   right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
