__Summary__
Israel loses all truth, mercy, and knowledge of God and goes whoring after false gods.

---
###### 1 
Hear the word of the , ye children of Israel: for the  hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because  no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.

###### 2 
By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

###### 3 
Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.

###### 4 
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people  as they that strive with the priest.

###### 5 
Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.

###### 6 
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

###### 7 
As they were increased, so they sinned against me:  will I change their glory into shame.

###### 8 
They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.

###### 9 
And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

###### 10 
For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the .

###### 11 
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

###### 12 
My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused  to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.

###### 13 
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof  good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

###### 14 
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people  doth not understand shall fall.

###### 15 
Though thou, Israel, play the harlot,  let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The  liveth.

###### 16 
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the  will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

###### 17 
Ephraim  joined to idols: let him alone.

###### 18 
Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers  shame do love, Give ye.

###### 19 
The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
