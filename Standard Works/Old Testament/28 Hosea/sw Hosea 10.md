> __Summary__
Israel has plowed wickedness and reaped iniquityâ€”Hosea calls upon Israel to seek the Lord.

###### 1 
Israel  an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.

###### 2 
Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

###### 3 
For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the ; what then should a king do to us?

###### 4 
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.

###### 5 
The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof  rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.

###### 6 
It shall be also carried unto Assyria  a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.

###### 7 
 Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.

###### 8 
The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.

###### 9 
O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.

###### 10 
 in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.

###### 11 
And Ephraim  an heifer  taught,  loveth to tread out  but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow,  Jacob shall break his clods.

###### 12 
Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for  time to seek the , till he come and rain righteousness upon you.

###### 13 
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.

###### 14 
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon  children.

###### 15 
So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
