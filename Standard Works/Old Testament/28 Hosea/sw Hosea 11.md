__Summary__
Israel, as a child, was called out of Egypt in similitude of our Lord, as a child, coming out of Egypt—But Ephraim turns away from the Lord.

---
###### 1 
When Israel  a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.

###### 2 
 they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

###### 3 
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.

###### 4 
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

###### 5 
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.

###### 6 
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour  because of their own counsels.

###### 7 
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt 

###### 8 
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?  shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah?  shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.

###### 9 
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I  God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

###### 10 
They shall walk after the : he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.

###### 11 
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the .

###### 12 
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
