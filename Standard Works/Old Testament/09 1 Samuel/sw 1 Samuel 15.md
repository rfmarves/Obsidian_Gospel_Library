> __Summary__
Saul is commanded to smite and destroy the Amalekites and all that they have—He saves some animals to sacrifice—Saul is rejected as king and told that to obey is better than sacrifice—Samuel destroys Agag.

###### 1 
Samuel also said unto Saul, The  sent me to anoint thee  king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the .

###### 2 
Thus saith the  of hosts, I remember  which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid  for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

###### 3 
Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

###### 4 
And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

###### 5 
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

###### 6 
And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

###### 7 
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah  thou comest to Shur, that  over against Egypt.

###### 8 
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

###### 9 
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all  good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing  vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

###### 10 
Then came the word of the  unto Samuel, saying,

###### 11 
It repenteth me that I have set up Saul  king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the  all night.

###### 12 
And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

###### 13 
And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed  thou of the : I have performed the commandment of the .

###### 14 
And Samuel said, What  then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

###### 15 
And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the  thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

###### 16 
Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the  hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

###### 17 
And Samuel said, When thou  little in thine own sight,  thou not  the head of the tribes of Israel, and the  anointed thee king over Israel?

###### 18 
And the  sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.

###### 19 
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the , but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the ?

###### 20 
And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the , and have gone the way which the  sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

###### 21 
But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the  thy God in Gilgal.

###### 22 
And Samuel said, Hath the   delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the ? Behold, to obey  better than sacrifice,  to hearken than the fat of rams.

###### 23 
For rebellion  the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness  iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the , he hath also rejected thee from  king.

###### 24 
And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the , and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

###### 25 
Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the .

###### 26 
And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the , and the  hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.

###### 27 
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

###### 28 
And Samuel said unto him, The  hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,  better than thou.

###### 29 
And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he  not a man, that he should repent.

###### 30 
Then he said, I have sinned:  honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the  thy God.

###### 31 
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the .

###### 32 
Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.

###### 33 
And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the  in Gilgal.

###### 34 
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.

###### 35 
And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the  repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
