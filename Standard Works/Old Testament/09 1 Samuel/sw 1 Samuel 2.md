###### 1 
And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the , mine horn is exalted in the : my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

###### 2 
 none holy as the : for  none beside thee: neither  any rock like our God.

###### 3 
Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let  arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the   a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.

###### 4 
The bows of the mighty men  broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.

###### 5

###### 6 
The  killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

###### 7 
The  maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

###### 8 
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,  lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set  among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth  the ’s, and he hath set the world upon them.

###### 9 
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

###### 10 
The adversaries of the  shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the  shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.

###### 11 
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the  before Eli the priest.

###### 12 
Now the sons of Eli  sons of Belial; they knew not the .

###### 13 
And the priests’ custom with the people  when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;

###### 14 
And he struck  into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

###### 15 
Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

###### 16 
And  any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and  take  as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him,  but thou shalt give  now: and if not, I will take  by force.

###### 17 
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the : for men abhorred the offering of the .

###### 18 
But Samuel ministered before the ,  a child, girded with a linen ephod.

###### 19 
Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

###### 20 
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The  give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the . And they went unto their own home.

###### 21 
And the  visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the .

###### 22 
Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

###### 23 
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.

###### 24 
Nay, my sons; for  no good report that I hear: ye make the ’s people to transgress.

###### 25 
If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the , who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the  would slay them.

###### 26 
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the , and also with men.

###### 27 
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the , Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?

###### 28 
And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel  my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

###### 29 
Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded  habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?

###### 30 
Wherefore the  God of Israel saith, I said indeed  thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the  saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

###### 31 
Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

###### 32 
And thou shalt see an enemy  habitation, in all  which  shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.

###### 33 
And the man of thine,  I shall not cut off from mine altar,  to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

###### 34 
And this  a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

###### 35 
And I will raise me up a faithful priest,  shall do according to  which  in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

###### 36 
And it shall come to pass,  every one that is left in thine house shall come  crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
