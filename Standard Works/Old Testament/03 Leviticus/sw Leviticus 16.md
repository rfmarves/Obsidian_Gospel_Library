###### 13 
And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that  upon the testimony, that he die not:

###### 14 
And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle  with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

###### 15 
Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that  for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

###### 16 
And he shall make an atonement for the holy  because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

###### 21 
And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send  away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

###### 22 
And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

###### 23 
And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy  and shall leave them there:

###### 24 
And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.

For on that day shall  make an atonement for you, to cleanse you,  ye may be clean from all your sins before the .

###### 33 
And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

###### 34
