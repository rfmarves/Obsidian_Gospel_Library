###### 1 
And the  spake unto Moses, saying,

###### 2 
Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This  the thing which the  hath commanded, saying,

###### 3 
What man soever  of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth  out of the camp,

###### 4 
And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the  before the tabernacle of the ; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:

###### 5 
To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them  peace offerings unto the .

###### 6 
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the .

###### 7 
And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.

###### 8 
And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man  of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

###### 9 
And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the ; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

###### 10 
And whatsoever man  of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

###### 11 
For the life of the flesh  in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it  the blood  maketh an atonement for the soul.

###### 12 
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.

###### 13 
And whatsoever man  of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

###### 14 
For  the life of all flesh; the blood of it  for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh  the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

###### 15 
And every soul that eateth that which died  or that which was torn  one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe  in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

###### 16 
But if he wash  not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
