###### 11 
Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;

###### 12 
Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God  upon him: I  the .

###### 13 
And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

###### 14 
A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane,  an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

###### 15 
Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the  do sanctify him.

###### 16 
And the  spake unto Moses, saying,

###### 17 
Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever  of thy seed in their generations that hath  blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.

###### 18 
For whatsoever man  that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,

###### 19 
Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
