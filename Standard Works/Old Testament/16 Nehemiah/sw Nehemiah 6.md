__Summary__
Sanballat engages in intrigue against Nehemiah and the building of the wallâ€”The Jews finish the construction of the wall.

---
###### 1 
Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and  there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

###### 2 
That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in  the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.

###### 3 
And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I  doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

###### 4 
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.

###### 5 
Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

###### 6 
Wherein  written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith  thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.

###### 7 
And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,  a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.

###### 8 
Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

###### 9 
For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore,  strengthen my hands.

###### 10 
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who  shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

###### 11 
And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who  that,  as I  would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.

###### 12 
And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

###### 13 
Therefore  he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and  they might have  for an evil report, that they might reproach me.

###### 14 
My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

###### 15 
So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth  of  Elul, in fifty and two days.

###### 16 
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard  and all the heathen that  about us saw  they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.

###### 17 
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and  of Tobiah came unto them.

###### 18 
For  many in Judah sworn unto him, because he  the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

###### 19 
Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him.  Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
