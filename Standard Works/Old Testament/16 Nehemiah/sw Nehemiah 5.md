> __Summary__
Many Jews are in bondage to their fellow Jews—At Nehemiah’s direction they are freed, their lands are restored, and the taking of usury is discontinued.

###### 1 
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.

###### 2 
For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,  many: therefore we take up corn  that we may eat, and live.

###### 3 
 also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.

###### 4 
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute,  our lands and vineyards.

###### 5 
Yet now our flesh  as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and  of our daughters are brought unto bondage  neither  in our power  for other men have our lands and vineyards.

###### 6 
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

###### 7 
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

###### 8 
And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing 

###### 9 
Also I said, It  not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?

###### 10 
I likewise,  my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

###### 11 
Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth  of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.

###### 12 
Then said they, We will restore  and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.

###### 13 
Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the . And the people did according to this promise.

###### 14 
Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king,  twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.

###### 15 
But the former governors that  before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.

###### 16 
Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants  gathered thither unto the work.

###### 17 
Moreover  at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that  about us.

###### 18 
Now  which was prepared  daily  one ox  six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

###### 19 
Think upon me, my God, for good,  to all that I have done for this people.
