> __Summary__
Labor not to be rich—As a man thinks in his heart, so is he—Withhold not correction from a child—Be not among drunkards.

###### 1 
When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what  before thee:

###### 2 
And put a knife to thy throat, if thou  a man given to appetite.

###### 3 
Be not desirous of his dainties: for they  deceitful meat.

###### 4 
Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

###### 5 
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for  certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.

###### 6 
Eat thou not the bread of  an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:

###### 7 
For as he thinketh in his heart, so  he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart  not with thee.

###### 8 
The morsel  thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.

###### 9 
Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.

###### 10 
Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:

###### 11 
For their redeemer  mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.

###### 12 
Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.

###### 13 
Withhold not correction from the child: for  thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.

###### 14 
Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.

###### 15 
My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.

###### 16 
Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

###### 17 
Let not thine heart envy sinners: but  in the fear of the  all the day long.

###### 18 
For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.

###### 19 
Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

###### 20 
Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

###### 21 
For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe  with rags.

###### 22 
Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.

###### 23 
Buy the truth, and sell  not;  wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.

###### 24 
The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise  shall have joy of him.

###### 25 
Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.

###### 26 
My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

###### 27 
For a whore  a deep ditch; and a strange woman  a narrow pit.

###### 28 
She also lieth in wait as  a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.

###### 29 
Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

###### 30 
They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

###### 31 
Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup,  it moveth itself aright.

###### 32 
At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

###### 33 
Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.

###### 34 
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

###### 35 
They have stricken me,  I was not sick; they have beaten me,  I felt  not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
