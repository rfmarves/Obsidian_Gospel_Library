__Summary__
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband—The way of a fool is right in his own eyes—Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.

---
###### 1 
Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof  brutish.

###### 2 
A good  obtaineth favour of the : but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.

###### 3 
A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

###### 4 
A virtuous woman  a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed  as rottenness in his bones.

###### 5 
The thoughts of the righteous  right:  the counsels of the wicked  deceit.

###### 6 
The words of the wicked  to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

###### 7 
The wicked are overthrown, and  not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.

###### 8 
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

###### 9 
 despised, and hath a servant,  better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

###### 10 
A righteous  regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked  cruel.

###### 11 
He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain  void of understanding.

###### 12 
The wicked desireth the net of evil  but the root of the righteous yieldeth 

###### 13 
The wicked is snared by the transgression of  lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.

###### 14 
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of  mouth: and the recompence of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.

###### 15 
The way of a fool  right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel  wise.

###### 16 
A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent  covereth shame.

###### 17 
 speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.

###### 18 
There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise  health.

###### 19 
The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue  but for a moment.

###### 20 
Deceit  in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace  joy.

###### 21 
There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.

###### 22 
Lying lips  abomination to the : but they that deal truly  his delight.

###### 23 
A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.

###### 24 
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.

###### 25 
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.

###### 26 
The righteous  more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.

###### 27 
The slothful  roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man  precious.

###### 28 
In the way of righteousness  life; and  the pathway  no death.
