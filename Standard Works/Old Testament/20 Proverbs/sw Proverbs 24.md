> __Summary__
In a multitude of counselors there is safety—Fret not yourself because of evil men—It is not good to show partiality in judgment.

###### 1 
Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.

###### 2 
For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.

###### 3 
Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:

###### 4 
And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.

###### 5 
A wise man  strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.

###### 6 
For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors  safety.

###### 7 
Wisdom  too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.

###### 8 
He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.

###### 9 
The thought of foolishness  sin: and the scorner  an abomination to men.

###### 10 
 thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength  small.

###### 11 
If thou forbear to deliver  drawn unto death, and  ready to be slain;

###### 12 
If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider  and he that keepeth thy soul, doth  he know  and shall  he render to  man according to his works?

###### 13 
My son, eat thou honey, because  good; and the honeycomb,  sweet to thy taste:

###### 14 
So  the knowledge of wisdom  unto thy soul: when thou hast found  then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.

###### 15 
Lay not wait, O wicked  against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:

###### 16 
For a just  falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.

###### 17 
Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:

###### 18 
Lest the  see  and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.

###### 19 
Fret not thyself because of evil  neither be thou envious at the wicked;

###### 20 
For there shall be no reward to the evil  the candle of the wicked shall be put out.

###### 21 
My son, fear thou the  and the king:  meddle not with them that are given to change:

###### 22 
For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?

###### 23 
These  also  to the wise.  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.

###### 24 
He that saith unto the wicked, Thou  righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

###### 25 
But to them that rebuke  shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.

###### 26 
 shall kiss  lips that giveth a right answer.

###### 27 
Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.

###### 28 
Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive  with thy lips.

###### 29 
Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.

###### 30 
I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;

###### 31 
And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,  nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.

###### 32 
Then I saw,  considered  well: I looked upon  received instruction.

###### 33 
 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

###### 34 
So shall thy poverty come  one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.
