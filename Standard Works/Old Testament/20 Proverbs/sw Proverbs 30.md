__Summary__
Every word of God is pure—Give me neither poverty nor riches.

---
###### 1 
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh,  the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

###### 2 
Surely I  more brutish than  man, and have not the understanding of a man.

###### 3 
I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

###### 4 
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what  his name, and what  his son’s name, if thou canst tell?

###### 5 
Every word of God  pure: he  a shield unto them that put their trust in him.

###### 6 
Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

###### 7 
Two  have I required of thee; deny me  not before I die:

###### 8 
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

###### 9 
Lest I be full, and deny  and say, Who  the ? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God 

###### 10 
Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.

###### 11 
 a generation  curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.

###### 12 
 a generation  pure in their own eyes, and  is not washed from their filthiness.

###### 13 
 a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.

###### 14 
 a generation, whose teeth  swords, and their jaw teeth  knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from  men.

###### 15 
The horseleach hath two daughters,  Give, give. There are three  are never satisfied,  four  say not,  enough:

###### 16 
The grave; and the barren womb; the earth  is not filled with water; and the fire  saith not,  enough.

###### 17 
The eye  mocketh at  father, and despiseth to obey  mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.

###### 18 
There be three  are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:

###### 19 
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.

###### 20 
Such  the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

###### 21 
For three  the earth is disquieted, and for four  it cannot bear:

###### 22 
For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;

###### 23 
For an odious  when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.

###### 24 
There be four  little upon the earth, but they  exceeding wise:

###### 25 
The ants  a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;

###### 26 
The conies  a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;

###### 27 
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;

###### 28 
The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.

###### 29 
There be three  which go well, yea, four are comely in going:

###### 30 
A lion  strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;

###### 31 
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom  no rising up.

###### 32 
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil,  thine hand upon thy mouth.

###### 33 
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
