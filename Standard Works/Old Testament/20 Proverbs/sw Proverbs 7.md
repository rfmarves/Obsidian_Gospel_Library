> __Summary__
An immoral woman leads a man to destruction as an ox to the slaughterâ€”The house of an adulterous woman is the way to hell.

###### 1 
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

###### 2 
Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

###### 3 
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

###### 4 
Say unto wisdom, Thou  my sister; and call understanding  kinswoman:

###### 5 
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger  flattereth with her words.

###### 6 
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

###### 7 
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

###### 8 
Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

###### 9 
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

###### 10 
And, behold, there met him a woman  the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

###### 11 
(She  loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

###### 12 
Now  without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

###### 13 
So she caught him, and kissed him,  with an impudent face said unto him,

###### 14 
 peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

###### 15 
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

###### 16 
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved  with fine linen of Egypt.

###### 17 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

###### 18 
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

###### 19 
For the goodman  not at home, he is gone a long journey:

###### 20 
He hath taken a bag of money with him,  will come home at the day appointed.

###### 21 
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

###### 22 
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

###### 23 
Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it  for his life.

###### 24 
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.

###### 25 
Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

###### 26 
For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong  have been slain by her.

###### 27 
Her house  the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
