> __Summary__
Rebuke a wise man and he will love you—The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom—The guests of an immoral woman are in the depths of hell.

###### 1 
Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:

###### 2 
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

###### 3 
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,

###### 4 
Whoso  simple, let him turn in hither:  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

###### 5 
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine  I have mingled.

###### 6 
Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

###### 7 
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked  himself a blot.

###### 8 
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.

###### 9 
Give  to a wise  and he will be yet wiser: teach a just  and he will increase in learning.

###### 10 
The fear of the   the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy  understanding.

###### 11 
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

###### 12 
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but  thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear 

###### 13 
A foolish woman  clamorous:  simple, and knoweth nothing.

###### 14 
For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

###### 15 
To call passengers who go right on their ways:

###### 16 
Whoso  simple, let him turn in hither: and  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

###### 17 
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread  in secret is pleasant.

###### 18 
But he knoweth not that the dead  there;  her guests  in the depths of hell.
