> __Summary__
The state and rewards of the righteous and the wicked are contrasted—When a wicked man dies, his expectations perish—He who wins souls is wise.

###### 1 
A false balance  abomination to the : but a just weight  his delight.

###### 2 
 pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly  wisdom.

###### 3 
The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

###### 4 
Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.

###### 5 
The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

###### 6 
The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in  naughtiness.

###### 7 
When a wicked man dieth,  expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust  perisheth.

###### 8 
The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.

###### 9 
An hypocrite with  mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

###### 10 
When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish,  shouting.

###### 11 
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

###### 12 
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.

###### 13 
A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.

###### 14 
Where no counsel  the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors  safety.

###### 15 
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart  and he that hateth suretiship is sure.

###### 16 
A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong  retain riches.

###### 17 
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but  cruel troubleth his own flesh.

###### 18 
The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness  a sure reward.

###### 19 
As righteousness  to life: so he that pursueth evil  to his own death.

###### 20 
They that are of a froward heart  abomination to the : but  upright in  way  his delight.

###### 21 
 hand  in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

###### 22 
 a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout,  a fair woman which is without discretion.

###### 23 
The desire of the righteous  only good:  the expectation of the wicked  wrath.

###### 24 
There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and  that withholdeth more than is meet, but  to poverty.

###### 25 
The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.

###### 26 
He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing  upon the head of him that selleth 

###### 27 
He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

###### 28 
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.

###### 29 
He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool  servant to the wise of heart.

###### 30 
The fruit of the righteous  a tree of life; and he that winneth souls  wise.

###### 31 
Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
