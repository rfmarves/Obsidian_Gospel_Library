> __Summary__
The wicked flee when no man pursues—Whoever walks uprightly will be saved—A faithful man will abound with blessings.

###### 1 
The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

###### 2 
For the transgression of a land many  the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding  knowledge the state  shall be prolonged.

###### 3 
A poor man that oppresseth the poor  a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.

###### 4 
They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.

###### 5 
Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the  understand all 

###### 6 
Better  the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than  perverse  ways, though he  rich.

###### 7 
Whoso keepeth the law  a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous  shameth his father.

###### 8 
He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

###### 9 
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer  abomination.

###### 10 
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good  in possession.

###### 11 
The rich man  wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.

###### 12 
When righteous  do rejoice,  great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

###### 13 
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh  shall have mercy.

###### 14 
Happy  the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.

###### 15 
 a roaring lion, and a ranging bear;  a wicked ruler over the poor people.

###### 16 
The prince that wanteth understanding  also a great oppressor:  he that hateth covetousness shall prolong  days.

###### 17 
A man that doeth violence to the blood of  person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

###### 18 
Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but  perverse  ways shall fall at once.

###### 19 
He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain  shall have poverty enough.

###### 20 
A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

###### 21 
To have respect of persons  not good: for for a piece of bread  man will transgress.

###### 22 
He that hasteth to be rich  an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.

###### 23 
He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.

###### 24 
Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith,  no transgression; the same  the companion of a destroyer.

###### 25 
He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the  shall be made fat.

###### 26 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

###### 27 
He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

###### 28 
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
