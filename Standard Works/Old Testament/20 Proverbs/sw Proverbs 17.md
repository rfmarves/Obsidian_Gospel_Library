> __Summary__
He who is glad at calamities will be punished—A friend loves at all times—Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise.

###### 1 
Better  a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices  strife.

###### 2 
A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

###### 3 
The fining pot  for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the  trieth the hearts.

###### 4 
A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;  a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.

###### 5 
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:  he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

###### 6 
Children’s children  the crown of old men; and the glory of children  their fathers.

###### 7 
Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.

###### 8 
A gift  a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

###### 9 
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth  friends.

###### 10 
A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.

###### 11 
An evil  seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.

###### 12 
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.

###### 13 
Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

###### 14 
The beginning of strife  when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

###### 15 
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both  abomination to the .

###### 16 
Wherefore  a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing  no heart 

###### 17 
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.

###### 18 
A man void of understanding striketh hands,  becometh surety in the presence of his friend.

###### 19 
He loveth transgression that loveth strife:  he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

###### 20 
He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

###### 21 
He that begetteth a fool  to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.

###### 22 
A merry heart doeth good  a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.

###### 23 
A wicked  taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.

###### 24 
Wisdom  before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool  in the ends of the earth.

###### 25 
A foolish son  a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.

###### 26 
Also to punish the just  not good,  to strike princes for equity.

###### 27 
He that hath knowledge spareth his words:  a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.

###### 28 
Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:  he that shutteth his lips  a man of understanding.
