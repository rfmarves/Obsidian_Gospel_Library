__Summary__
The Lord gives wisdom, knowledge, and understandingâ€”Walk in the way of good men.

---
###### 1 
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;

###### 2 
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom,  apply thine heart to understanding;

###### 3 
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,  liftest up thy voice for understanding;

###### 4 
If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as  hid treasures;

###### 5 
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the , and find the knowledge of God.

###### 6 
For the  giveth wisdom: out of his mouth  knowledge and understanding.

###### 7 
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous:  a buckler to them that walk uprightly.

###### 8 
He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.

###### 9 
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity;  every good path.

###### 10 
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;

###### 11 
Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

###### 12 
To deliver thee from the way of the evil  from the man that speaketh froward things;

###### 13 
Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;

###### 14 
Who rejoice to do evil,  delight in the frowardness of the wicked;

###### 15 
Whose ways  crooked, and  froward in their paths:

###### 16 
To deliver thee from the strange woman,  from the stranger  flattereth with her words;

###### 17 
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.

###### 18 
For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.

###### 19 
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.

###### 20 
That thou mayest walk in the way of good  and keep the paths of the righteous.

###### 21 
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.

###### 22 
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
