> __Summary__
The way of the transgressor is hard—Evil pursues sinners—He who does not discipline his children hates them.

###### 1 
A wise son  his father’s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.

###### 2 
A man shall eat good by the fruit of  mouth: but the soul of the transgressors  violence.

###### 3 
He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:  he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

###### 4 
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and  nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

###### 5 
A righteous  hateth lying: but a wicked  is loathsome, and cometh to shame.

###### 6 
Righteousness keepeth  upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

###### 7 
There is that maketh himself rich, yet  nothing:  that maketh himself poor, yet  great riches.

###### 8 
The ransom of a man’s life  his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.

###### 9 
The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.

###### 10 
Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised  wisdom.

###### 11 
Wealth  by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.

###### 12 
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but  the desire cometh,  a tree of life.

###### 13 
Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

###### 14 
The law of the wise  a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.

###### 15 
Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors  hard.

###### 16 
Every prudent  dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open  folly.

###### 17 
A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador  health.

###### 18 
Poverty and shame  him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

###### 19 
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but  abomination to fools to depart from evil.

###### 20 
He that walketh with wise  shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

###### 21 
Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.

###### 22 
A good  leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children: and the wealth of the sinner  laid up for the just.

###### 23 
Much food  the tillage of the poor: but there is  destroyed for want of judgment.

###### 24 
He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.

###### 25 
The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
