__Summary__
Boast not of false gifts—Give food and drink to your enemy.

###### 1 
These  also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.

###### 2 
 the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings  to search out a matter.

###### 3 
The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings  unsearchable.

###### 4 
Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.

###### 5 
Take away the wicked  before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.

###### 6 
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great 

###### 7 
For better  that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.

###### 8 
Go not forth hastily to strive, lest  what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

###### 9 
Debate thy cause with thy neighbour  and discover not a secret to another:

###### 10 
Lest he that heareth  put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.

###### 11 
A word fitly spoken  apples of gold in pictures of silver.

###### 12 
 an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,  a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

###### 13 
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,  a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.

###### 14 
Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift  clouds and wind without rain.

###### 15 
By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.

###### 16 
Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

###### 17 
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee, and  hate thee.

###### 18 
A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour  a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

###### 19 
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble  a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

###### 20 
 he that taketh away a garment in cold weather,  vinegar upon nitre, so  he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.

###### 21 
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:

###### 22 
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the  shall reward thee.

###### 23 
The north wind driveth away rain: so  an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.

###### 24 
 better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.

###### 25 
 cold waters to a thirsty soul, so  good news from a far country.

###### 26 
A righteous man falling down before the wicked  a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

###### 27 
 not good to eat much honey: so  to search their own glory  glory.

###### 28 
He that  no rule over his own spirit  a city  broken down,  without walls.
