> __Summary__
Six things that the Lord hates are named—Those who commit adultery destroy their own souls.

###### 1 
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend,  thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,

###### 2 
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.

###### 3 
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

###### 4 
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

###### 5 
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand  and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

###### 6 
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

###### 7 
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

###### 8 
Provideth her meat in the summer,  gathereth her food in the harvest.

###### 9 
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

###### 10 
 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

###### 11 
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

###### 12 
A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

###### 13 
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;

###### 14 
Frowardness  in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.

###### 15 
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.

###### 16 
These six  doth the  hate: yea, seven  an abomination unto him:

###### 17 
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

###### 18 
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,

###### 19 
A false witness  speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

###### 20 
My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

###### 21 
Bind them continually upon thine heart,  tie them about thy neck.

###### 22 
When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and  thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

###### 23 
For the commandment  a lamp; and the law  light; and reproofs of instruction  the way of life:

###### 24 
To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

###### 25 
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

###### 26 
For by means of a whorish woman  to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

###### 27 
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

###### 28 
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

###### 29 
So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.

###### 30 
 do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

###### 31 
But  he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.

###### 32 
 whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he  doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

###### 33 
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

###### 34 
For jealousy  the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

###### 35 
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
