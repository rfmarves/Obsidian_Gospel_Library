> __Summary__
Let another man praise you—A prudent man foresees evil—Hell and destruction are never full.

###### 1 
Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

###### 2 
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.

###### 3 
A stone  heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath  heavier than them both.

###### 4 
Wrath  cruel, and anger  outrageous; but who  able to stand before envy?

###### 5 
Open rebuke  better than secret love.

###### 6 
Faithful  the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy  deceitful.

###### 7 
The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.

###### 8 
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so  a man that wandereth from his place.

###### 9 
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so  the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.

###### 10 
Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity:  better  a neighbour  near than a brother far off.

###### 11 
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.

###### 12 
A prudent  foreseeth the evil,  hideth himself;  the simple pass on,  are punished.

###### 13 
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

###### 14 
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

###### 15 
A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.

###### 16 
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand,  bewrayeth 

###### 17 
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

###### 18 
Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

###### 19 
As in water face  to face, so the heart of man to man.

###### 20 
Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

###### 21 
 the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so  a man to his praise.

###### 22 
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,  will not his foolishness depart from him.

###### 23 
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,  look well to thy herds.

###### 24 
For riches  not for ever: and doth the crown  to every generation?

###### 25 
The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

###### 26 
The lambs  for thy clothing, and the goats  the price of the field.

###### 27 
And  goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and  the maintenance for thy maidens.
