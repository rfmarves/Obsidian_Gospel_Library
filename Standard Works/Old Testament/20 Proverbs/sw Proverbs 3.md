__Summary__
Write mercy and truth upon the tablet of your heart—Trust in the Lord—Honor Him with your substance—Whom the Lord loves He corrects—Happy is the man who finds wisdom.

---
###### 1 
My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:

###### 2 
For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

###### 3 
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

###### 4 
So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

###### 5 
Trust in the  with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

###### 6 
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

###### 7 
Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the , and depart from evil.

###### 8 
It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

###### 9 
Honour the  with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:

###### 10 
So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

###### 11 
My son, despise not the chastening of the ; neither be weary of his correction:

###### 12 
For whom the  loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son  he delighteth.

###### 13 
Happy  the man  findeth wisdom, and the man  getteth understanding.

###### 14 
For the merchandise of it  better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

###### 15 
She  more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

###### 16 
Length of days  in her right hand;  in her left hand riches and honour.

###### 17 
Her ways  ways of pleasantness, and all her paths  peace.

###### 18 
She  a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy  that retaineth her.

###### 19 
The  by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.

###### 20 
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.

###### 21 
My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:

###### 22 
So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

###### 23 
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.

###### 24 
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

###### 25 
Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.

###### 26 
For the  shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.

###### 27 
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do 

###### 28 
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

###### 29 
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.

###### 30 
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.

###### 31 
Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

###### 32 
For the froward  abomination to the : but his secret  with the righteous.

###### 33 
The curse of the   in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.

###### 34 
Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.

###### 35 
The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
