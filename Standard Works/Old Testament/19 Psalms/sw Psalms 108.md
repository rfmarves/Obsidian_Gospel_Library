A Song or Psalm of David.

---

---
__Summary__
David praises and exalts God—Judah is the Lord’s lawgiver.

---
###### 1 
O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

###### 2 
Awake, psaltery and harp: I  will awake early.

###### 3 
I will praise thee, O , among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.

###### 4 
For thy mercy  great above the heavens: and thy truth  unto the clouds.

###### 5 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;

###### 6 
That thy beloved may be delivered: save  thy right hand, and answer me.

###### 7 
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

###### 8 
Gilead  mine; Manasseh  mine; Ephraim also  the strength of mine head; Judah  my lawgiver;

###### 9 
Moab  my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.

###### 10 
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

###### 11 
 not  O God,  hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?

###### 12 
Give us help from trouble: for vain  the help of man.

###### 13 
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he  shall tread down our enemies.
