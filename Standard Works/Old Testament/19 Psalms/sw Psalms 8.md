To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
A messianic psalm of David—He says that babes and children praise the Lord—He asks, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?

###### 1 
O  our Lord, how excellent  thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

###### 2 
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.

###### 3 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

###### 4 
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

###### 5 
For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.

###### 6 
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all  under his feet:

###### 7 
All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

###### 8 
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea,  passeth through the paths of the seas.

###### 9 
O  our Lord, how excellent  thy name in all the earth!
