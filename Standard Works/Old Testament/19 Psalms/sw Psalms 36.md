To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David the servant of the Lord.
```

> __Summary__
David praises the Lord for His mercy, His righteousness, and His loving kindnessâ€”The fountain of life is with the Lord.

###### 1 
The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,  no fear of God before his eyes.

###### 2 
For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

###### 3 
The words of his mouth  iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise,  to do good.

###### 4 
He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way  not good; he abhorreth not evil.

###### 5 
Thy mercy, O ,  in the heavens;  thy faithfulness  unto the clouds.

###### 6 
Thy righteousness  like the great mountains; thy judgments  a great deep: O , thou preservest man and beast.

###### 7 
How excellent  thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

###### 8 
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

###### 9 
For with thee  the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.

###### 10 
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

###### 11 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.

###### 12 
There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
