> __Summary__
The righteous cry unto the Lordâ€”They remember the wonders of old, how He redeemed the sons of Jacob and led Israel like a flock.

###### 1 
I cried unto God with my voice,  unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.

###### 2 
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

###### 3 
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. .

###### 4 
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

###### 5 
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

###### 6 
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

###### 7 
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?

###### 8 
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth  promise fail for evermore?

###### 9 
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? .

###### 10 
And I said, This  my infirmity:  the years of the right hand of the most High.

###### 11 
I will remember the works of the : surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

###### 12 
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

###### 13 
Thy way, O God,  in the sanctuary: who  great a God as  God?

###### 14 
Thou  the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.

###### 15 
Thou hast with  arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. .

###### 16 
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.

###### 17 
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.

###### 18 
The voice of thy thunder  in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

###### 19 
Thy way  in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.

###### 20 
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
