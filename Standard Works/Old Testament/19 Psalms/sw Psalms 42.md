> __Summary__
The souls of the righteous thirst for Godâ€”The wicked say, Where is your God?

###### 1 
As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

###### 2 
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?

###### 3 
My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where  thy God?

###### 4 
When I remember these  I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.

###### 5 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and  art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him  the help of his countenance.

###### 6 
O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.

###### 7 
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

###### 8 
 the  will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night his song  with me,  my prayer unto the God of my life.

###### 9 
I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

###### 10 
 with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where  thy God?

###### 11 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him,  the health of my countenance, and my God.
