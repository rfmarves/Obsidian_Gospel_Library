__Summary__
David praises God with thanksgiving—Who is like unto the Lord!

---
###### 1 
In thee, O , do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.

###### 2 
Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

###### 3 
Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou  my rock and my fortress.

###### 4 
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

###### 5 
For thou  my hope, O Lord :  my trust from my youth.

###### 6 
By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise  continually of thee.

###### 7 
I am as a wonder unto many; but thou  my strong refuge.

###### 8 
Let my mouth be filled  thy praise  thy honour all the day.

###### 9 
Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.

###### 10 
For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,

###### 11 
Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for  none to deliver 

###### 12 
O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

###### 13 
Let them be confounded  consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered  reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.

###### 14 
But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.

###### 15 
My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness  thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers 

###### 16 
I will go in the strength of the Lord : I will make mention of thy righteousness,  of thine only.

###### 17 
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.

###### 18 
Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto  generation,  thy power to every one  is to come.

###### 19 
Thy righteousness also, O God,  very high, who hast done great things: O God, who  like unto thee!

###### 20 
 which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

###### 21 
Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

###### 22 
I will also praise thee with the psaltery,  thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.

###### 23 
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

###### 24 
My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
