A Song or Psalm of Asaph.

---

---
__Summary__
God is asked to confound the enemies of His peopleâ€”Jehovah is the Most High over all the earth.

---
###### 1 
Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

###### 2 
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

###### 3 
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

###### 4 
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from  a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

###### 5 
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

###### 6 
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

###### 7 
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

###### 8 
Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. .

###### 9 
Do unto them as  the Midianites; as  Sisera, as  Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

###### 10 
 perished at En-dor: they became  dung for the earth.

###### 11 
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

###### 12 
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

###### 13 
O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

###### 14 
As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

###### 15 
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

###### 16 
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O .

###### 17 
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

###### 18 
That  may know that thou, whose name alone  ,  the most high over all the earth.
