To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

__Summary__
Men cannot be ransomed or redeemed by wealth—God alone can redeem a soul from the grave—The glory of a rich man ceases with his death.

---
###### 1 
Hear this, all  people; give ear, all  inhabitants of the world:

###### 2 
Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

###### 3 
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart  of understanding.

###### 4 
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.

###### 5 
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,  the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?

###### 6 
They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;

###### 7 
None  can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:

###### 8 
(For the redemption of their soul  precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)

###### 9 
That he should still live for ever,  not see corruption.

###### 10 
For he seeth  wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

###### 11 
Their inward thought  their houses  for ever,  their dwelling places to all generations; they call  lands after their own names.

###### 12 
Nevertheless man  in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts  perish.

###### 13 
This their way  their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. .

###### 14 
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.

###### 15 
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. .

###### 16 
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;

###### 17 
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.

###### 18 
Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and  will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

###### 19 
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.

###### 20 
Man  in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts  perish.
