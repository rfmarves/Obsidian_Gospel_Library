###### 1 
, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

###### 2 
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

###### 3 
 backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

###### 4 
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the .  sweareth to  hurt, and changeth not.

###### 5 
 putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these  shall never be moved.
