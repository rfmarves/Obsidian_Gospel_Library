```

> __Summary__
The righteous cry unto the living God—It is better to be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord than to dwell in the tents of wickedness—No good thing is withheld from those who walk uprightly.

###### 1 
How amiable  thy tabernacles, O  of hosts!

###### 2 
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

###### 3 
Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,  thine altars, O  of hosts, my King, and my God.

###### 4 
Blessed  they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. .

###### 5 
Blessed  the man whose strength  in thee; in whose heart  the ways 

###### 6 
 passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.

###### 7 
They go from strength to strength,  in Zion appeareth before God.

###### 8 
O  God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. .

###### 9 
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.

###### 10 
For a day in thy courts  better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.

###### 11 
For the  God  a sun and shield: the  will give grace and glory: no good  will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.

###### 12 
O  of hosts, blessed  the man that trusteth in thee.
