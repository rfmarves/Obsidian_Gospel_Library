###### 1 
, remember David,  all his afflictions:

###### 2 
How he sware unto the ,  vowed unto the mighty  of Jacob;

###### 3 
Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

###### 4 
I will not give sleep to mine eyes,  slumber to mine eyelids,

###### 5 
Until I find out a place for the , an habitation for the mighty  of Jacob.

###### 6 
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.

###### 7 
We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

###### 8 
Arise, O , into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

###### 9 
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.

###### 10 
For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.

The  hath sworn  truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

###### 12

###### 13 
For the  hath chosen Zion; he hath desired  for his habitation.

###### 14 
This  my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

###### 15 
I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

###### 16 
I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

###### 17 
There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

###### 18 
His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
