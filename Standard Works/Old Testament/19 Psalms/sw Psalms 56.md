__Summary__
David seeks mercy, trusts in and praises the Lord, and thanks Him for deliverance.

---
###### 1 
Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.

###### 2 
Mine enemies would daily swallow  up: for  many that fight against me, O thou most High.

###### 3 
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

###### 4 
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

###### 5 
Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts  against me for evil.

###### 6 
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

###### 7 
Shall they escape by iniquity? in  anger cast down the people, O God.

###### 8 
Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:  not in thy book?

###### 9 
When I cry  then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God  for me.

###### 10 
In God will I praise  word: in the  will I praise  word.

###### 11 
In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

###### 12 
Thy vows  upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

###### 13 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death:  not  my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
