A Psalm of Asaph.

---

---
__Summary__
God is good to Israel—The wicked and ungodly prosper in this world—They will be consumed with terrors hereafter—Those who trust in the Lord will be received up unto glory.

---
###### 1 
Truly God  good to Israel,  to such as are of a clean heart.

###### 2 
But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

###### 3 
For I was envious at the foolish,  I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

###### 4 
For  no bands in their death: but their strength  firm.

###### 5 
They  not in trouble  men; neither are they plagued like  men.

###### 6 
Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them  a garment.

###### 7 
Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.

###### 8 
They are corrupt, and speak wickedly  oppression: they speak loftily.

###### 9 
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.

###### 10 
Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full  are wrung out to them.

###### 11 
And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?

###### 12 
Behold, these  the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase  riches.

###### 13 
Verily I have cleansed my heart  vain, and washed my hands in innocency.

###### 14 
For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.

###### 15 
If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend  the generation of thy children.

###### 16 
When I thought to know this, it  too painful for me;

###### 17 
Until I went into the sanctuary of God;  understood I their end.

###### 18 
Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.

###### 19 
How are they  into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.

###### 20 
As a dream when  awaketh;  O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.

###### 21 
Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

###### 22 
So foolish  I, and ignorant: I was  a beast before thee.

###### 23 
Nevertheless I  continually with thee: thou hast holden  by my right hand.

###### 24 
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me  glory.

###### 25 
Whom have I in heaven  and  none upon earth  I desire beside thee.

###### 26 
My flesh and my heart faileth:  God  the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

###### 27 
For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

###### 28 
But  good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord , that I may declare all thy works.
