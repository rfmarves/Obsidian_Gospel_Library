To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim-Eduth, A Psalm of Asaph.

__Summary__
Israel pleads with the Shepherd of Israel for deliverance, for salvation, and for His face to shine upon them.

---
###### 1 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest  the cherubims, shine forth.

###### 2 
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come  save us.

###### 3 
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

###### 4 
O  God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?

###### 5 
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.

###### 6 
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.

###### 7 
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

###### 8 
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.

###### 9 
Thou preparedst  before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.

###### 10 
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof  the goodly cedars.

###### 11 
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.

###### 12 
Why hast thou  broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?

###### 13 
The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.

###### 14 
Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

###### 15 
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch  thou madest strong for thyself.

###### 16 
 burned with fire,  cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.

###### 17 
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man  thou madest strong for thyself.

###### 18 
So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.

###### 19 
Turn us again, O  God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
