To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David prays for deliverance from his enemies—The Lord maintains the cause of the poor and afflicted.

###### 1 
Deliver me, O , from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;

###### 2 
Which imagine mischiefs in  heart; continually are they gathered together  war.

###### 3 
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison  under their lips. .

###### 4 
Keep me, O , from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.

###### 5 
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. .

###### 6 
I said unto the , Thou  my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O .

###### 7 
O  the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.

###### 8 
Grant not, O , the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device;  they exalt themselves. .

###### 9 
 the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

###### 10 
Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

###### 11 
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow 

###### 12 
I know that the  will maintain the cause of the afflicted,  the right of the poor.

###### 13 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
