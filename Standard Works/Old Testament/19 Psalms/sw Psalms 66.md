###### 17 
I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.

###### 18 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear 

###### 19 
 verily God hath heard  he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

###### 20 
Blessed  God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
