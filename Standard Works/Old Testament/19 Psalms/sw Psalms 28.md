```
A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David pleads with the Lord to hear his voice and grant his petitionsâ€”David prays, Save Thy people and bless Thine inheritance.

###### 1 
Unto thee will I cry, O  my rock; be not silent to me: lest,  thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

###### 2 
Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

###### 3 
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief  in their hearts.

###### 4 
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.

###### 5 
Because they regard not the works of the , nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

###### 6 
Blessed  the , because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.

###### 7 
The   my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

###### 8 
The   their strength, and he  the saving strength of his anointed.

###### 9 
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
