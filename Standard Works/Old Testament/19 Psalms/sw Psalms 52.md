__Summary__
David says that wicked tongues devise mischief and the wicked trust in richesâ€”The Saints trust in the mercy of God forever.

---
###### 1 
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God  continually.

###### 2 
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.

###### 3 
Thou lovest evil more than good;  lying rather than to speak righteousness. .

###### 4 
Thou lovest all devouring words, O  deceitful tongue.

###### 5 
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of  dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. .

###### 6 
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:

###### 7 
Lo,  the man  made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches,  strengthened himself in his wickedness.

###### 8 
But I  like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

###### 9 
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done  and I will wait on thy name; for  good before thy saints.
