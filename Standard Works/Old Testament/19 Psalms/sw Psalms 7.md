```
Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
```

> __Summary__
David trusts in the Lord, who will judge the peopleâ€”God is angry with the wicked.

###### 1 
O  my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

###### 2 
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending  in pieces, while  none to deliver.

###### 3 
O  my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

###### 4 
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

###### 5 
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take  yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. .

###### 6 
Arise, O , in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me  the judgment  thou hast commanded.

###### 7 
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

###### 8 
The  shall judge the people: judge me, O , according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity  in me.

###### 9 
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

###### 10 
My defence  of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

###### 11 
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry  every day.

###### 12 
If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

###### 13 
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

###### 14 
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

###### 15 
He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch  he made.

###### 16 
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

###### 17 
I will praise the  according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the  most high.
