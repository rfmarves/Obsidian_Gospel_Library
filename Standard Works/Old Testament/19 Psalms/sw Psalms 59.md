__Summary__
David prays to be delivered from his enemiesâ€”God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.

###### 1 
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.

###### 2 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

###### 3 
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not  my transgression, nor  my sin, O .

###### 4 
They run and prepare themselves without  fault: awake to help me, and behold.

###### 5 
Thou therefore, O  God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. .

###### 6 
They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

###### 7 
Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords  in their lips: for who,  doth hear?

###### 8 
But thou, O , shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.

###### 9 
 his strength will I wait upon thee: for God  my defence.

###### 10 
The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see  upon mine enemies.

###### 11 
Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

###### 12 
 the sin of their mouth  the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying  they speak.

###### 13 
Consume  in wrath, consume  that they  not  and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. .

###### 14 
And at evening let them return;  let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.

###### 15 
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.

###### 16 
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.

###### 17 
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God  my defence,  the God of my mercy.
