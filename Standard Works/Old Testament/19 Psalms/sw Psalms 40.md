###### 1 
I waited patiently for the ; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

###### 2 
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock,  established my goings.

###### 3 
And he hath put a new song in my mouth,  praise unto our God: many shall see  and fear, and shall trust in the .

###### 4 
Blessed  that man that maketh the  his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

###### 5 
Many, O  my God,  thy wonderful works  thou hast done, and thy thoughts  to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee:  I would declare and speak  they are more than can be numbered.

###### 6 
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

###### 7 
Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book  written of me,

###### 8 
I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law  within my heart.

###### 9 
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O , thou knowest.

###### 10 
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

###### 11 
Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O : let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

###### 12 
For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.

###### 13 
Be pleased, O , to deliver me: O , make haste to help me.

###### 14 
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

###### 15 
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

###### 16 
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The  be magnified.

###### 17 
But I  poor and needy;  the Lord thinketh upon me: thou  my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
