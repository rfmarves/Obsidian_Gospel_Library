To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David testifies, The heavens declare the glory of God, the law of the Lord is perfect, and the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

###### 1 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

###### 2 
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

###### 3 
 no speech nor language,  their voice is not heard.

###### 4 
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

###### 5 
Which  as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,  rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

###### 6 
His going forth  from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

###### 7 
The law of the   perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the   sure, making wise the simple.

###### 8 
The statutes of the   right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the   pure, enlightening the eyes.

###### 9 
The fear of the   clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the   true  righteous altogether.

###### 10 
More to be desired  than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

###### 11 
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:  in keeping of them  great reward.

###### 12 
Who can understand  errors? cleanse thou me from secret 

###### 13 
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous  let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

###### 14 
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O , my strength, and my redeemer.
