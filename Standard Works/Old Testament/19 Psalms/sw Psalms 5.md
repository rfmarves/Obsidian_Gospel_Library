```
To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David asks the Lord to hear his voice—The Lord hates workers of iniquity—He blesses and shields the righteous.

###### 1 
Give ear to my words, O , consider my meditation.

###### 2 
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.

###### 3 
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O ; in the morning will I direct  unto thee, and will look up.

###### 4 
For thou  not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.

###### 5 
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.

###### 6 
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the  will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

###### 7 
But as for me, I will come  thy house in the multitude of thy mercy:  in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.

###### 8 
Lead me, O , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.

###### 9 
For  no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part  very wickedness; their throat  an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.

###### 10 
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.

###### 11 
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

###### 12 
For thou, , wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as  a shield.
