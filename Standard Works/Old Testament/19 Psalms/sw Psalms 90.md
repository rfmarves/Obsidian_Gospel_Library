A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
```

> __Summary__
A prayer of Moses, the man of God—God is from everlasting to everlasting—Man’s days last but seventy years—Moses implores the Lord to give mercy and blessings to His people.

###### 1 
, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

###### 2 
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou  God.

###### 3 
Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.

###### 4 
For a thousand years in thy sight  as yesterday when it is past, and  a watch in the night.

###### 5 
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are  a sleep: in the morning  like grass  groweth up.

###### 6 
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

###### 7 
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.

###### 8 
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret  in the light of thy countenance.

###### 9 
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale 

###### 10 
The days of our years  threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength  fourscore years, yet  their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

###### 11 
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear,  thy wrath.

###### 12 
So teach  to number our days, that we may apply  hearts unto wisdom.

###### 13 
Return, O , how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.

###### 14 
O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

###### 15 
Make us glad according to the days  thou hast afflicted us,  the years  we have seen evil.

###### 16 
Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.

###### 17 
And let the beauty of the  our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
