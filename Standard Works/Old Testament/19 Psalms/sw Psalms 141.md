```
A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David pleads with the Lord to hear his prayers—The reproof of the righteous is a kindness.

###### 1 
, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.

###### 2 
Let my prayer be set forth before thee  incense;  the lifting up of my hands  the evening sacrifice.

###### 3 
Set a watch, O , before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.

###### 4 
Incline not my heart to  evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.

###### 5 
Let the righteous smite me;  a kindness: and let him reprove me;  an excellent oil,  shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also  in their calamities.

###### 6 
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.

###### 7 
Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth  upon the earth.

###### 8 
But mine eyes  unto thee, O  the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.

###### 9 
Keep me from the snares  they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.

###### 10 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
