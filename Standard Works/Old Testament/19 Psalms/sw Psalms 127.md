Children are a heritage from the Lord.

###### 1 
Except the  build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the  keep the city, the watchman waketh  in vain.

###### 2 
 vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows:  so he giveth his beloved sleep.

###### 3 
Lo, children  an heritage of the :  the fruit of the womb  reward.

###### 4 
As arrows  in the hand of a mighty man; so  children of the youth.

###### 5 
Happy  the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
