__Summary__
The Lord governs the sea and the land for the blessing of His people.

---
###### 1 
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

###### 2 
Judah was his sanctuary,  Israel his dominion.

###### 3 
The sea saw  and fled: Jordan was driven back.

###### 4 
The mountains skipped like rams,  the little hills like lambs.

###### 5 
What  thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,  thou wast driven back?

###### 6 
Ye mountains,  ye skipped like rams;  ye little hills, like lambs?

###### 7 
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

###### 8 
Which turned the rock  a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
