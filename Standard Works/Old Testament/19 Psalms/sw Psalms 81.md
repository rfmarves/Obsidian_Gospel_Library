To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of Asaph.
```

> __Summary__
Israel is commanded to sing praises to God—If the Israelites had walked in the Lord’s ways, they would have triumphed over their enemies.

###### 1 
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.

###### 2 
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.

###### 3 
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.

###### 4 
For this  a statute for Israel,  a law of the God of Jacob.

###### 5 
This he ordained in Joseph  a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt:  I heard a language  I understood not.

###### 6 
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.

###### 7 
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. .

###### 8 
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;

###### 9 
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.

###### 10 
I  the  thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

###### 11 
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.

###### 12 
So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust:  they walked in their own counsels.

###### 13 
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me,  Israel had walked in my ways!

###### 14 
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.

###### 15 
The haters of the  should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.

###### 16 
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
