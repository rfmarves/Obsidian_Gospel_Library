To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

---

---
__Summary__
David proclaims, Let God be magnified.

---
###### 1 
 O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O .

###### 2 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.

###### 3 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.

###### 4 
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

###### 5 
But I  poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou  my help and my deliverer; O , make no tarrying.
