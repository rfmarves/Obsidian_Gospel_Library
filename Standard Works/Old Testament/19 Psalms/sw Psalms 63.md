A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

---

---
__Summary__
David thirsts for God, whom he praises with joyful lips.

---
###### 1 
O God, thou  my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;

###### 2 
To see thy power and thy glory, so  I have seen thee in the sanctuary.

###### 3 
Because thy lovingkindness  better than life, my lips shall praise thee.

###### 4 
Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.

###### 5 
My soul shall be satisfied as  marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise  with joyful lips:

###### 6 
When I remember thee upon my bed,  meditate on thee in the  watches.

###### 7 
Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

###### 8 
My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.

###### 9 
But those  seek my soul, to destroy  shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

###### 10 
They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.

###### 11 
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
