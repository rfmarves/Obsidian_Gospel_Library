A Psalm of David.

---

---
__Summary__
David declares, The Lord is my shepherd.

---
###### 1 
The   my shepherd; I shall not want.

###### 2 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

###### 3 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake.

###### 4 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou  with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

###### 5 
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

###### 6 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the  for ever.
