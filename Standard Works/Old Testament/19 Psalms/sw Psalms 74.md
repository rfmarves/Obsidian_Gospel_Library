__Summary__
O God, remember Thy chosen congregation—The wicked destroy the sanctuary and burn the synagogues—O God, remember them for their deeds, and save Thy people.

###### 1 
O God, why hast thou cast  off for ever?  doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

###### 2 
Remember thy congregation,  thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance,  thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

###### 3 
Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations;  all  the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

###### 4 
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns  signs.

###### 5 
 was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.

###### 6 
But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.

###### 7 
They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled  the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

###### 8 
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

###### 9 
We see not our signs:  no more any prophet: neither  among us any that knoweth how long.

###### 10 
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

###### 11 
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck  out of thy bosom.

###### 12 
For God  my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

###### 13 
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.

###### 14 
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces,  gavest him  meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

###### 15 
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.

###### 16 
The day  thine, the night also  thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.

###### 17 
Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

###### 18 
Remember this,  the enemy hath reproached, O , and  the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

###### 19 
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude  forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

###### 20 
Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

###### 21 
O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.

###### 22 
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.

###### 23 
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
