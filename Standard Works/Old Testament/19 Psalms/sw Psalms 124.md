```
A Song of degrees of David.
```

> __Summary__
David says, Israelâ€™s help is in the name of the Lord.

###### 1 
If  not  the  who was on our side, now may Israel say;

###### 2 
If  not  the  who was on our side, when men rose up against us:

###### 3 
Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:

###### 4 
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:

###### 5 
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

###### 6 
Blessed  the , who hath not given us  a prey to their teeth.

###### 7 
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

###### 8 
Our help  in the name of the , who made heaven and earth.
