```
To the chief Musician upon Neginah, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David finds shelter in the Lord, abides in the Lord’s presence, and keeps his own vows.

###### 1 
Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

###### 2 
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock  is higher than I.

###### 3 
For thou hast been a shelter for me,  a strong tower from the enemy.

###### 4 
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. .

###### 5 
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given  the heritage of those that fear thy name.

###### 6 
Thou wilt prolong the king’s life:  his years as many generations.

###### 7 
He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,  may preserve him.

###### 8 
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
