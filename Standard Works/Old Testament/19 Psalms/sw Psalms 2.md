> __Summary__
A messianic psalm—The heathen will rage against the Lord’s anointed—The Lord speaks of His Son, whom He has begotten.

###### 1 
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

###### 2 
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the , and against his anointed, 

###### 3 
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

###### 4 
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.

###### 5 
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

###### 6 
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

###### 7 
I will declare the decree: the  hath said unto me, Thou  my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

###### 8 
Ask of me, and I shall give  the heathen  thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth  thy possession.

###### 9 
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.

###### 10 
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

###### 11 
Serve the  with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

###### 12 
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish  the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed  all they that put their trust in him.
