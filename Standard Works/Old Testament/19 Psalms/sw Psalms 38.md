A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.

---

---
__Summary__
David sorrows for his sins—They rest as a disease upon him—He asks the Lord to be compassionate.

---
###### 1 
O , rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

###### 2 
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

###### 3 
 no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither  rest in my bones because of my sin.

###### 4 
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

###### 5 
My wounds stink  are corrupt because of my foolishness.

###### 6 
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

###### 7 
For my loins are filled with a loathsome  and  no soundness in my flesh.

###### 8 
I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

###### 9 
Lord, all my desire  before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

###### 10 
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

###### 11 
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

###### 12 
They also that seek after my life lay snares  and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

###### 13 
But I, as a deaf  heard not; and  as a dumb man  openeth not his mouth.

###### 14 
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth  no reproofs.

###### 15 
For in thee, O , do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

###### 16 
For I said,  lest  they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify  against me.

###### 17 
For I  ready to halt, and my sorrow  continually before me.

###### 18 
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

###### 19 
But mine enemies  lively,  they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

###### 20 
They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow  good 

###### 21 
Forsake me not, O : O my God, be not far from me.

###### 22 
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
