```
A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David complains of his enemies and their wrong dealingsâ€”He asks the Lord to judge him according to his righteousness.

###### 1 
Plead  O , with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.

###### 2 
Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

###### 3 
Draw out also the spear, and stop  against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I  thy salvation.

###### 4 
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

###### 5 
Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the  chase 

###### 6 
Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the  persecute them.

###### 7 
For without cause have they hid for me their net  a pit,  without cause they have digged for my soul.

###### 8 
Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.

###### 9 
And my soul shall be joyful in the : it shall rejoice in his salvation.

###### 10 
All my bones shall say, , who  like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

###### 11 
False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge  that I knew not.

###### 12 
They rewarded me evil for good  the spoiling of my soul.

###### 13 
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing  sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.

###### 14 
I behaved myself as though  my friend  brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth  mother.

###### 15 
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:  the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew  not; they did tear  and ceased not:

###### 16 
With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.

###### 17 
Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.

###### 18 
I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.

###### 19 
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:  let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

###### 20 
For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against  quiet in the land.

###### 21 
Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me,  said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen 

###### 22 
 thou hast seen, O : keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.

###### 23 
Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment,  unto my cause, my God and my Lord.

###### 24 
Judge me, O  my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

###### 25 
Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

###### 26 
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify  against me.

###### 27 
Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the  be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

###### 28 
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness  of thy praise all the day long.
