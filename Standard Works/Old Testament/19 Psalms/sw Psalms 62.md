To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David praises God as his defense, his rock, and his salvationâ€”The Lord judges men according to their works.

###### 1 
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him  my salvation.

###### 2 
He only  my rock and my salvation;  my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.

###### 3 
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall  a tottering fence.

###### 4 
They only consult to cast  down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. .

###### 5 
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation  from him.

###### 6 
He only  my rock and my salvation:  my defence; I shall not be moved.

###### 7 
In God  my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,  my refuge,  in God.

###### 8 
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God  a refuge for us. .

###### 9 
Surely men of low degree  vanity,  men of high degree  a lie: to be laid in the balance, they  altogether  than vanity.

###### 10 
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart 

###### 11 
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power  unto God.

###### 12 
Also unto thee, O Lord,  mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
