###### 1 
I will love thee, O , my strength.

###### 2 
The   my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation,  my high tower.

###### 3 
I will call upon the ,  to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

###### 4 
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

###### 5 
The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.

###### 6 
In my distress I called upon the , and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him,  into his ears.

###### 7 
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

###### 8 
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

###### 9 
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness  under his feet.

###### 10 
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

###### 11 
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him  dark waters  thick clouds of the skies.

###### 12 
At the brightness  before him his thick clouds passed, hail  and coals of fire.

###### 13 
The  also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail  and coals of fire.

###### 14 
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.

###### 15 
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

###### 16 
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

###### 17 
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.

###### 18 
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the  was my stay.

###### 19 
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

###### 20 
The  rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

###### 21 
For I have kept the ways of the , and have not wickedly departed from my God.

###### 22 
For all his judgments  before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.

###### 23 
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

###### 24 
Therefore hath the  recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

###### 25 
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

###### 26 
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

###### 27 
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.

###### 28 
For thou wilt light my candle: the  my God will enlighten my darkness.

###### 29 
For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

###### 30 
 God, his way  perfect: the word of the  is tried: he  a buckler to all those that trust in him.

###### 31 
For who  God save the ? or who  a rock save our God?

###### 32 
 God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

###### 33 
He maketh my feet like hinds’  and setteth me upon my high places.

###### 34 
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

###### 35 
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

###### 36 
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

###### 37 
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.

###### 38 
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.

###### 39 
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

###### 40 
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

###### 41 
They cried, but  none to save  unto the , but he answered them not.

###### 42 
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

###### 43 
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;  thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people  I have not known shall serve me.

###### 44 
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.

###### 45 
The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

###### 46 
The  liveth; and blessed  my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

###### 47 
 God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

###### 48 
He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

###### 49 
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O , among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

###### 50 
Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
