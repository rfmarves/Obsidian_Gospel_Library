> __Summary__
A messianic psalm—The Messiah is fairer than the children of men—He is anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows—His name will be remembered in all generations.

###### 1 
My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue  the pen of a ready writer.

###### 2 
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

###### 3 
Gird thy sword upon  thigh, O  mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.

###### 4 
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness  righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.

###### 5 
Thine arrows  sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies;  the people fall under thee.

###### 6 
Thy throne, O God,  for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom  a right sceptre.

###### 7 
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

###### 8 
All thy garments  of myrrh, and aloes,  cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

###### 9 
Kings’ daughters  among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

###### 10 
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;

###### 11 
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he  thy Lord; and worship thou him.

###### 12 
And the daughter of Tyre  with a gift;  the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour.

###### 13 
The king’s daughter  all glorious within: her clothing  of wrought gold.

###### 14 
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.

###### 15 
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.

###### 16 
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.

###### 17 
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
