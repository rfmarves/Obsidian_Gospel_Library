A Psalm for Solomon.

---

---
__Summary__
David speaks of Solomon, who is made a type of the Messiah—He will have dominion—His name will endure forever—All nations will call him blessed—The whole earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord.

---
###### 1 
Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.

###### 2 
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.

###### 3 
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

###### 4 
He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

###### 5 
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.

###### 6 
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers  water the earth.

###### 7 
In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

###### 8 
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

###### 9 
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

###### 10 
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

###### 11 
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

###### 12 
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and  that hath no helper.

###### 13 
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.

###### 14 
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

###### 15 
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually;  daily shall he be praised.

###### 16 
There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and  of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

###### 17 
His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and  shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

###### 18 
Blessed  the  God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.

###### 19 
And blessed  his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled  his glory; Amen, and Amen.

###### 20 
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
