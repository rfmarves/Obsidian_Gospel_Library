A Song of degrees of David.
```

> __Summary__
David says, It is pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity!

###### 1 
Behold, how good and how pleasant  for brethren to dwell together in unity!

###### 2 
 like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard,  Aaronâ€™s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;

###### 3 
As the dew of Hermon,  that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the  commanded the blessing,  life for evermore.
