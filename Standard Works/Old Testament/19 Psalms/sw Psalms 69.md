To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
A messianic psalm of David—The zeal of the Lord’s house has eaten Him up—Reproach has broken His heart—He is given gall and vinegar to drink—He is persecuted—He will save Zion.

###### 1 
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto  soul.

###### 2 
I sink in deep mire, where  no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

###### 3 
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

###### 4 
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me,  mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored  which I took not away.

###### 5 
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.

###### 6 
Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord  of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

###### 7 
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.

###### 8 
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.

###### 9 
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

###### 10 
When I wept,  my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.

###### 11 
I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.

###### 12 
They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I  the song of the drunkards.

###### 13 
But as for me, my prayer  unto thee, O ,  an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.

###### 14 
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

###### 15 
Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

###### 16 
Hear me, O ; for thy lovingkindness  good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

###### 17 
And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.

###### 18 
Draw nigh unto my soul,  redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.

###### 19 
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries  all before thee.

###### 20 
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked  to take pity, but  none; and for comforters, but I found none.

###### 21 
They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

###### 22 
Let their table become a snare before them: and  for  welfare,  a trap.

###### 23 
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

###### 24 
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.

###### 25 
Let their habitation be desolate;  let none dwell in their tents.

###### 26 
For they persecute  whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

###### 27 
Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.

###### 28 
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.

###### 29 
But I  poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.

###### 30 
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.

###### 31 
 also shall please the  better than an ox  bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

###### 32 
The humble shall see  be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.

###### 33 
For the  heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.

###### 34 
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.

###### 35 
For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

###### 36 
The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
