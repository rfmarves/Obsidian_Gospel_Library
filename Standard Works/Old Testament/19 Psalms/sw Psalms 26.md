A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__

###### 2

###### 3

###### 4

###### 5 
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.

###### 6 
I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O :

###### 7 
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.

###### 8 
, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.

###### 9 
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

###### 10 
In whose hands  mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.

###### 11 
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.

###### 12 
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the .
