To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
A messianic psalm of David—Blessed is he who considers the poor—The treachery of Judas is foretold.

###### 1 
Blessed  he that considereth the poor: the  will deliver him in time of trouble.

###### 2 
The  will preserve him, and keep him alive;  he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

###### 3 
The  will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

###### 4 
I said, , be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

###### 5 
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

###### 6 
And if he come to see  he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself;  he goeth abroad, he telleth 

###### 7 
All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

###### 8 
An evil disease,  cleaveth fast unto him: and  that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

###### 9 
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up  heel against me.

###### 10 
But thou, O , be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

###### 11 
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

###### 12 
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

###### 13 
Blessed  the  God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
