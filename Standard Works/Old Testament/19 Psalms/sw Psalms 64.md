To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

---

---
__Summary__
David prays for safetyâ€”The righteous will be glad in heart.

---
###### 1 
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

###### 2 
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

###### 3 
Who whet their tongue like a sword,  bend  their arrows,  bitter words:

###### 4 
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.

###### 5 
They encourage themselves  an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

###### 6 
They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward  of every one  and the heart,  deep.

###### 7 
But God shall shoot at them  an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.

###### 8 
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.

###### 9 
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.

###### 10 
The righteous shall be glad in the , and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
