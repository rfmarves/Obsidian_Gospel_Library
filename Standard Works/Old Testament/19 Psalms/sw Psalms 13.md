To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

---

---
__Summary__
David trusts in the Lordâ€™s mercy and rejoices in His salvation.

---
###### 1 
How long wilt thou forget me, O ? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

###### 2 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul,  sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

###### 3 
Consider  hear me, O  my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the  death;

###### 4 
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;  those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

###### 5 
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.

###### 6 
I will sing unto the , because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
