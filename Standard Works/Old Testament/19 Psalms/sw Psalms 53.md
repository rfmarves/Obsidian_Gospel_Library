```
To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David says, The fool says there is no God—There is none who does good—Gathered Israel will rejoice.

###### 1 
The fool hath said in his heart,  no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity:  none that doeth good.

###### 2 
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were  that did understand, that did seek God.

###### 3 
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy;  none that doeth good, no, not one.

###### 4 
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people  they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

###### 5 
There were they in great fear,  no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth  thee: thou hast put  to shame, because God hath despised them.

###### 6 
Oh that the salvation of Israel  out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,  Israel shall be glad.
