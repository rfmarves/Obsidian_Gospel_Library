> __Summary__
A prayer of one who feels forsaken and who asks whether the Lordâ€™s loving kindness will be declared in the grave.

###### 1 
O  God of my salvation, I have cried day  night before thee:

###### 2 
Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

###### 3 
For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.

###### 4 
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man  no strength:

###### 5 
Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.

###### 6 
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

###### 7 
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted  with all thy waves. .

###### 8 
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them:  shut up, and I cannot come forth.

###### 9 
Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: , I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

###### 10 
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise  praise thee? .

###### 11 
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave?  thy faithfulness in destruction?

###### 12 
Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

###### 13 
But unto thee have I cried, O ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.

###### 14 
, why castest thou off my soul?  hidest thou thy face from me?

###### 15 
I  afflicted and ready to die from  youth up:  I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

###### 16 
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

###### 17 
They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.

###### 18 
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me,  mine acquaintance into darkness.
