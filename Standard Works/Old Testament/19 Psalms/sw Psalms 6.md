```
To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David cries unto the Lord for mercy—He asks to be healed and saved.

###### 1 
O , rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

###### 2 
Have mercy upon me, O ; for I  weak: O , heal me; for my bones are vexed.

###### 3 
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O , how long?

###### 4 
Return, O , deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.

###### 5 
For in death  no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?

###### 6 
I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.

###### 7 
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.

###### 8 
Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the  hath heard the voice of my weeping.

###### 9 
The  hath heard my supplication; the  will receive my prayer.

###### 10 
Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return  be ashamed suddenly.
