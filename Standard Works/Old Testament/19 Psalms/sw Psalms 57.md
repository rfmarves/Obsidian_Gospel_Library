__Summary__
David pleads for mercy and acclaims the glory and exaltation of God.

---
###### 1 
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until  calamities be overpast.

###### 2 
I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth  for me.

###### 3 
He shall send from heaven, and save me  the reproach of him that would swallow me up. . God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

###### 4 
My soul  among lions:  I lie  them that are set on fire,  the sons of men, whose teeth  spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

###### 5 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;  thy glory  above all the earth.

###### 6 
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen  .

###### 7 
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

###### 8 
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I  will awake early.

###### 9 
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.

###### 10 
For thy mercy  great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.

###### 11 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens:  thy glory  above all the earth.
