Unto thee, O , do I lift up my soul.

###### 2 
O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.

###### 3 
Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.

Shew me thy ways, O ; teach me thy paths.

###### 5 
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou  the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

###### 6 
Remember, O , thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they  ever of old.

Mine eyes  ever toward the ; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.

Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I  desolate and afflicted.

###### 17 
The troubles of my heart are enlarged:  bring thou me out of my distresses.

###### 18 
Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.

###### 19 
Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.

O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.

###### 21 
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
