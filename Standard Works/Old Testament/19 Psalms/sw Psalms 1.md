Blessed  the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

###### 2 
But his delight  in the law of the ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.

###### 3 
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

The ungodly  not so: but  like the chaff which the wind driveth away.

For the  knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
