To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David.
```

> __Summary__
David prays morning, noon, and nightâ€”He seeks protection and help against his enemies.

###### 1 
Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.

###### 2 
Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;

###### 3 
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

###### 4 
My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

###### 5 
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

###### 6 
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!  would I fly away, and be at rest.

###### 7 
Lo,  would I wander far off,  remain in the wilderness. .

###### 8 
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm  tempest.

###### 9 
Destroy, O Lord,  divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

###### 10 
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow  in the midst of it.

###### 11 
Wickedness  in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

###### 12 
For  not an enemy  reproached me; then I could have borne  neither  he that hated me  did magnify  against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

###### 13 
But  thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

###### 14 
We took sweet counsel together,  walked unto the house of God in company.

###### 15 
Let death seize upon them,  let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness  in their dwellings,  among them.

###### 16 
As for me, I will call upon God; and the  shall save me.

###### 17 
Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.

###### 18 
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle  against me: for there were many with me.

###### 19 
God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. . Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

###### 20 
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.

###### 21 
 of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war  in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet  they drawn swords.

###### 22 
Cast thy burden upon the , and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

###### 23 
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
