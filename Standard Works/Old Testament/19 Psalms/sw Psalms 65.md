To the chief Musician, A Psalm and Song of David.
```

> __Summary__
David speaks of the blessedness of God’s chosen—The Lord sends rain and good things upon the earth.

###### 1 
Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.

###### 2 
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

###### 3 
Iniquities prevail against me:  our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.

###### 4 
Blessed  thou choosest, and causest to approach  he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house,  of thy holy temple.

###### 5 
 terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation;  the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off  the sea:

###### 6 
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains;  girded with power:

###### 7 
Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.

###### 8 
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.

###### 9 
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God,  is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

###### 10 
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.

###### 11 
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.

###### 12 
They drop  the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.

###### 13 
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
