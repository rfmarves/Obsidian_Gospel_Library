###### 1 
Bless the , O my soul. O  my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

###### 2 
Who coverest  with light as  a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

###### 3 
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

###### 4 
Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

###### 5 
 laid the foundations of the earth,  it should not be removed for ever.

###### 6 
Thou coveredst it with the deep as  a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

###### 7 
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.

###### 8 
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.

###### 9 
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

###### 10 
He sendeth the springs into the valleys,  run among the hills.

###### 11 
They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

###### 12 
By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,  sing among the branches.

###### 13 
He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

###### 14 
He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

###### 15 
And wine  maketh glad the heart of man,  oil to make  face to shine, and bread  strengtheneth man’s heart.

###### 16 
The trees of the  are full  the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

###### 17 
Where the birds make their nests:  the stork, the fir trees  her house.

###### 18 
The high hills  a refuge for the wild goats;  the rocks for the conies.

###### 19 
He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.

###### 20 
Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep 

###### 21 
The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.

###### 22 
The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.

###### 23 
Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

###### 24 
O , how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

###### 25 
 this great and wide sea, wherein  things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.

###### 26 
There go the ships:  that leviathan,  thou hast made to play therein.

###### 27 
These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give  their meat in due season.

###### 28 
 thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.

###### 29 
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

###### 30 
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

###### 31 
The glory of the  shall endure for ever: the  shall rejoice in his works.

###### 32 
He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

###### 33 
I will sing unto the  as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

###### 34 
My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the .

###### 35 
Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the , O my soul. Praise ye the .
