###### 1 
Bless the , O my soul: and all that is within me,  his holy name.

###### 2 
Bless the , O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

###### 3 
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;

###### 4 
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

###### 5 
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good  thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.

###### 6 
The  executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.

###### 7 
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.

###### 8 
The   merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.

###### 9 
He will not always chide: neither will he keep  for ever.

###### 10 
He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.

###### 11 
For as the heaven is high above the earth,  great is his mercy toward them that fear him.

###### 12 
As far as the east is from the west,  far hath he removed our transgressions from us.

###### 13 
Like as a father pitieth  children,  the  pitieth them that fear him.

###### 14 
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we  dust.

###### 15 
 man, his days  as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

###### 16 
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.

###### 17 
But the mercy of the   from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;

###### 18 
To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.

###### 19 
The  hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

###### 20 
Bless the , ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

###### 21 
Bless ye the , all  his hosts;  ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

###### 22 
Bless the , all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the , O my soul.
