A Song of degrees.

> __Summary__
Lift up your eyes unto the Lord, and plead with Him for mercy.

###### 1 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.

###### 2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants  unto the hand of their masters,  as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes  upon the  our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

###### 3 
Have mercy upon us, O , have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

###### 4 
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease,  with the contempt of the proud.
