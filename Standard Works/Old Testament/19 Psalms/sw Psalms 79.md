A Psalm of Asaph.

---

---
__Summary__
The heathen nations destroy Jerusalem and defile the temple—Israel pleads for forgiveness and deliverance.

---
###### 1 
O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

###### 2 
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given  meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.

###### 3 
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and  none to bury 

###### 4 
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.

###### 5 
How long, ? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?

###### 6 
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

###### 7 
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.

###### 8 
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

###### 9 
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.

###### 10 
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where  their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight  the revenging of the blood of thy servants  shed.

###### 11 
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;

###### 12 
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

###### 13 
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
