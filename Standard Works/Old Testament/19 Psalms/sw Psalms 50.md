A Psalm of Asaph.

---

---
__Summary__
Asaph speaks of the Second Coming—The Lord accepts the sacrifices of the righteous and will deliver them—Those whose conduct is right will see the salvation of God.

---
###### 1 
The mighty God,  the , hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

###### 2 
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

###### 3 
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.

###### 4 
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.

###### 5 
Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.

###### 6 
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God  judge himself. .

###### 7 
Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I  God,  thy God.

###### 8 
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings,  continually before me.

###### 9 
I will take no bullock out of thy house,  he goats out of thy folds.

###### 10 
For every beast of the forest  mine,  the cattle upon a thousand hills.

###### 11 
I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field  mine.

###### 12 
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world  mine, and the fulness thereof.

###### 13 
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

###### 14 
Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:

###### 15 
And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.

###### 16 
But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or  thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?

###### 17 
Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.

###### 18 
When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.

###### 19 
Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

###### 20 
Thou sittest  speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.

###### 21 
These  hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether  as thyself:  I will reprove thee, and set  in order before thine eyes.

###### 22 
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear  in pieces, and  none to deliver.

###### 23 
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth  conversation  will I shew the salvation of God.
