> __Summary__
While in captivity, the Jews wept by the rivers of Babylon—Because of sorrow, they could not bear to sing the songs of Zion.

###### 1 
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

###### 2 
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

###### 3 
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us  mirth,  Sing us  of the songs of Zion.

###### 4 
How shall we sing the ’s song in a strange land?

###### 5 
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget 

###### 6 
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

###### 7 
Remember, O , the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase  rase  to the foundation thereof.

###### 8 
O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy  that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

###### 9 
Happy  that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
