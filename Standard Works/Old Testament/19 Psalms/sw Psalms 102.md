###### 1 
Hear my prayer, O , and let my cry come unto thee.

###### 2 
Hide not thy face from me in the day  I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day  I call answer me speedily.

###### 3 
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.

###### 4 
My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

###### 5 
By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

###### 6 
I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

###### 7 
I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

###### 8 
Mine enemies reproach me all the day;  they that are mad against me are sworn against me.

###### 9 
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

###### 10 
Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

###### 11 
My days  like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.

###### 12 
But thou, O , shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.

###### 13 
Thou shalt arise,  have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

###### 14 
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.

###### 15 
So the heathen shall fear the name of the , and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

###### 16 
When the  shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

###### 17 
He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.

###### 18 
This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the .

###### 19 
For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the  behold the earth;

###### 20 
To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

###### 21 
To declare the name of the  in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

###### 22 
When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the .

###### 23 
He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

###### 24 
I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years  throughout all generations.

###### 25 
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens  the work of thy hands.

###### 26 
They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

###### 27 
But thou  the same, and thy years shall have no end.

###### 28 
The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
