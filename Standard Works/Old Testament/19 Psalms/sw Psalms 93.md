__Summary__
The Lord reigns—He is from everlasting—Holiness adorns the house of the Lord forever.

---
###### 1 
The  reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the  is clothed with strength,  he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

###### 2 
Thy throne  established of old: thou  from everlasting.

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O , the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

###### 4 
The  on high  mightier than the noise of many waters,  the mighty waves of the sea.

###### 5 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O , for ever.
