__Summary__
David speaks of various acts of the wicked—God is not in their thoughts—But the Lord is King forever and ever—He will judge the fatherless and oppressed.

---
###### 1 
Why standest thou afar off, O ?  hidest thou  in times of trouble?

###### 2 
The wicked in  pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.

###### 3 
For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous,  the  abhorreth.

###### 4 
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek  God  not in all his thoughts.

###### 5 
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments  far above out of his sight:  all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

###### 6 
He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for  never  in adversity.

###### 7 
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue  mischief and vanity.

###### 8 
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.

###### 9 
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.

###### 10 
He croucheth,  humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.

###### 11 
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see 

###### 12 
Arise, O ; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.

###### 13 
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require 

###### 14 
Thou hast seen  for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite  with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

###### 15 
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil  seek out his wickedness  thou find none.

###### 16 
The   King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.

###### 17 
, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

###### 18 
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
