A Psalm of David, Maschil.
```

> __Summary__
David says, Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity—David acknowledges his sin—He recommends that the righteous be glad in the Lord and rejoice.

###### 1 
Blessed  transgression  forgiven,  sin  covered.

###### 2 
Blessed  the man unto whom the  imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit  no guile.

###### 3 
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.

###### 4 
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. .

###### 5 
I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. .

###### 6 
For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

###### 7 
Thou  my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. .

###### 8 
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

###### 9 
Be ye not as the horse,  as the mule,  have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

###### 10 
Many sorrows  to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the , mercy shall compass him about.

###### 11 
Be glad in the , and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all  upright in heart.
