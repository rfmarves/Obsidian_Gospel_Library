```
To the chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.

> __Summary__
David says that the Lord has scattered His peopleâ€”The Lord places Ephraim at the head and makes Judah His lawgiver.

###### 1 
O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

###### 2 
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

###### 3 
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.

###### 4 
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. .

###### 5 
That thy beloved may be delivered; save  thy right hand, and hear me.

###### 6 
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

###### 7 
Gilead  mine, and Manasseh  mine; Ephraim also  the strength of mine head; Judah  my lawgiver;

###### 8 
Moab  my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

###### 9 
Who will bring me  the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?

###### 10 
 not thou, O God,  hadst cast us off? and  O God,  didst not go out with our armies?

###### 11 
Give us help from trouble: for vain  the help of man.

###### 12 
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he  shall tread down our enemies.
