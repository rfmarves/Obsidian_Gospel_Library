###### 1 
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  far from helping me,  the words of my roaring?

###### 2 
O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.

###### 3 
But thou  holy,  that inhabitest the praises of Israel.

###### 4 
Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

###### 5 
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.

###### 6 
But I  a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

###### 7 
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, 

###### 8 
He trusted on the   he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

###### 9 
But thou  he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope  upon my mother’s breasts.

###### 10 
I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou  my God from my mother’s belly.

###### 11 
Be not far from me; for trouble  near; for  none to help.

###### 12 
Many bulls have compassed me: strong  of Bashan have beset me round.

###### 13 
They gaped upon me  their mouths,  a ravening and a roaring lion.

###### 14 
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

###### 15 
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

###### 16 
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

###### 17 
I may tell all my bones: they look  stare upon me.

###### 18 
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.

###### 19 
But be not thou far from me, O : O my strength, haste thee to help me.

###### 20 
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.

###### 21 
Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.

###### 22 
I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

###### 23 
Ye that fear the , praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

###### 24 
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.

###### 25 
My praise  of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

###### 26 
The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the  that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

###### 27 
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the : and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

###### 28 
For the kingdom  the ’s: and he  the governor among the nations.

###### 29 
All  fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.

###### 30 
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.

###### 31 
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done
