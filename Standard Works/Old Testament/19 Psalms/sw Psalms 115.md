__Summary__
Our God is in the heavens—Idols are false gods—Trust in the Lord.

###### 1 
Not unto us, O , not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy,  for thy truth’s sake.

###### 2 
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where  now their God?

###### 3 
But our God  in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.

###### 4 
Their idols  silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.

###### 5 
They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:

###### 6 
They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:

###### 7 
They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

###### 8 
They that make them are like unto them;  every one that trusteth in them.

O Israel, trust thou in the : he  their help and their shield.

###### 10 
O house of Aaron, trust in the : he  their help and their shield.

###### 11

###### 14 
The  shall increase you more and more, you and your children.

###### 15 
Ye  blessed of the  which made heaven and earth.

###### 16 
The heaven,  the heavens,  the ’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

###### 17 
The dead praise not the , neither any that go down into silence.

###### 18 
But we will bless the  from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the .
