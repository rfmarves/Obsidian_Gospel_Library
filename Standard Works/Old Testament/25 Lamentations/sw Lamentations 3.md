> __Summary__
Jeremiah, speaking for Judah, laments the calamity but trusts in the Lord and prays for deliverance.

###### 1 
I  the man  hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.

###### 2 
He hath led me, and brought  darkness, but not  light.

###### 3 
Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand  all the day.

###### 4 
My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.

###### 5 
He hath builded against me, and compassed  with gall and travail.

###### 6 
He hath set me in dark places, as  dead of old.

###### 7 
He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.

###### 8 
Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

###### 9 
He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.

###### 10 
He  unto me  a bear lying in wait,  a lion in secret places.

###### 11 
He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

###### 12 
He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

###### 13 
He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.

###### 14 
I was a derision to all my people;  their song all the day.

###### 15 
He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.

###### 16 
He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

###### 17 
And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.

###### 18 
And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the :

###### 19 
Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.

###### 20 
My soul hath  still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

###### 21 
This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

###### 22 
 the â€™s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.

###### 23 
 new every morning: great  thy faithfulness.

###### 24 
The   my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

###### 25 
The   good unto them that wait for him, to the soul  seeketh him.

###### 26 
 good that  should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the .

###### 27 
 good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

###### 28 
He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne  upon him.

###### 29 
He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

###### 30 
He giveth  cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.

###### 31 
For the Lord will not cast off for ever:

###### 32 
But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.

###### 33 
For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.

###### 34 
To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,

###### 35 
To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,

###### 36 
To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.

###### 37 
Who  he  saith, and it cometh to pass,  the Lord commandeth  not?

###### 38 
Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?

###### 39 
Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

###### 40 
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the .

###### 41 
Let us lift up our heart with  hands unto God in the heavens.

###### 42 
We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.

###### 43 
Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.

###### 44 
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that  prayer should not pass through.

###### 45 
Thou hast made us  the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.

###### 46 
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

###### 47 
Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

###### 48 
Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

###### 49 
Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,

###### 50 
Till the  look down, and behold from heaven.

###### 51 
Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.

###### 52 
Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

###### 53 
They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.

###### 54 
Waters flowed over mine head;  I said, I am cut off.

###### 55 
I called upon thy name, O , out of the low dungeon.

###### 56 
Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.

###### 57 
Thou drewest near in the day  I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.

###### 58 
O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

###### 59 
O , thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

###### 60 
Thou hast seen all their vengeance  all their imaginations against me.

###### 61 
Thou hast heard their reproach, O ,  all their imaginations against me;

###### 62 
The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.

###### 63 
Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I  their musick.

###### 64 
Render unto them a recompence, O , according to the work of their hands.

###### 65 
Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

###### 66 
Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the .
