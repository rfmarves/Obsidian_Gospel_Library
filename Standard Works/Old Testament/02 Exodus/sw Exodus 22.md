> __Summary__
The Lord reveals His laws pertaining to stealing, destructions by fire, care of the property of others, borrowing, lascivious acts, sacrifices to false gods, afflicting widows, usury, reviling God, and the firstborn of men and of animals—The men of Israel are commanded to be holy.

Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

###### 22 
Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

###### 23 
If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;

###### 24 
And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

###### 25 
If thou lend money to  my people  poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

###### 26 
If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

###### 27 
For that  his covering only, it  his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I  gracious.

###### 28 
Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

###### 29 
Thou shalt not delay  the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

###### 30 
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen,  with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

###### 31 
And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat  flesh  torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
