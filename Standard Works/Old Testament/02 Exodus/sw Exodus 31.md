###### 4 
To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,

###### 5 
And in cutting of stones, to set  and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

###### 6 
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that  thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

Six days may work be done; but in the seventh  the sabbath of rest, holy to the : whosoever doeth  work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
