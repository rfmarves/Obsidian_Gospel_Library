> __Summary__
Jeremiah prays because of dearth and famine—The Lord will not hear because of the wickedness of His people.

###### 1 
The word of the  that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth.

###### 2 
Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

###### 3 
And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits,  found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.

###### 4 
Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

###### 5 
Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook  because there was no grass.

###### 6 
And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because  no grass.

###### 7 
O , though our iniquities testify against us, do thou  for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.

###### 8 
O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man  turneth aside to tarry for a night?

###### 9 
Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man  cannot save? yet thou, O ,  in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.

###### 10 
Thus saith the  unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the  doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.

###### 11 
Then said the  unto me, Pray not for this people for  good.

###### 12 
When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.

###### 13 
Then said I, Ah, Lord ! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.

###### 14 
Then the  said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.

###### 15 
Therefore thus saith the  concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.

###### 16 
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.

###### 17 
Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.

###### 18 
If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.

###### 19 
Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and  no healing for us? we looked for peace, and  no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!

###### 20 
We acknowledge, O , our wickedness,  the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

###### 21 
Do not abhor  for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

###### 22 
Are there  among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers?  not thou he, O  our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these
