> __Summary__
In the last days, Judah and Israel will be gathered to their own lands—David, their king (the Messiah), will reign over them.

###### 1 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the , saying,

###### 2 
Thus speaketh the  God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

###### 3 
For, lo, the days come, saith the , that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the : and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

###### 4 
And these  the words that the  spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.

###### 5 
For thus saith the ; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.

###### 6 
Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

###### 7 
Alas! for that day  great, so that none  like it: it  even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.

###### 8 
For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the  of hosts,  I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:

###### 9 
But they shall serve the  their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.

###### 10 
Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the ; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make  afraid.

###### 11 
For I  with thee, saith the , to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.

###### 12 
For thus saith the , Thy bruise  incurable,  thy wound  grievous.

###### 13 
 none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.

###### 14 
All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;  thy sins were increased.

###### 15 
Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow  incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity:  thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.

###### 16 
Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.

###### 17 
For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the ; because they called thee an Outcast,  This  Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

###### 18 
Thus saith the ; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.

###### 19 
And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.

###### 20 
Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.

###### 21 
And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who  this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the .

###### 22 
And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

###### 23 
Behold, the whirlwind of the  goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.

###### 24 
The fierce anger of the  shall not return, until he have done  and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.
