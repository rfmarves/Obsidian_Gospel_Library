Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the  thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the .

###### 14 
Turn, O backsliding children, saith the ; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:

###### 15 
And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

###### 16 
And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the , they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the : neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit  neither shall  be done any more.

###### 23
