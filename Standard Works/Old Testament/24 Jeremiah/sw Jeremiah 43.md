###### 10 
And say unto them, Thus saith the  of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.

###### 11 
And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt,  such  for death to death; and such  for captivity to captivity; and such  for the sword to the sword.

###### 12 
And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.

###### 13 
He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that  in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
