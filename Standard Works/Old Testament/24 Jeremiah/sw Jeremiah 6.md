Therefore I am full of the fury of the ; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with  full of days.

And their houses shall be turned unto others,  fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the .

###### 13 
For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one  given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

###### 14 
They have healed also the hurt  of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when  no peace.

###### 15 
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time  I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the .

###### 16 
Thus saith the , Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where  the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk 

###### 17 
Also I set watchmen over you,  Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

###### 18 
Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what  among them.

###### 19 
Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,  the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

O daughter of my people, gird  with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning,  an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

###### 27 
I have set thee  a tower  a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.

###### 28
