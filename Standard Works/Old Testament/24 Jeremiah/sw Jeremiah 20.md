###### 4 
For thus saith the , Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold  and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.

###### 5 
Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.

###### 9

###### 10

###### 11 
But the   with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper:  everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.

###### 12 
But, O  of hosts, that triest the righteous,  seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.

###### 13 
Sing unto the , praise ye the : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

###### 14 
Cursed  the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.

###### 15 
Cursed  the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

###### 16 
And let that man be as the cities which the  overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;

###### 17 
Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb  always great 

###### 18 
Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
