> __Summary__
The people of Judah will suffer death, the sword, famine, and captivity—They will be scattered into all the kingdoms of the earth—Jerusalem will be destroyed.

###### 1 
Then said the  unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,  my mind  not  toward this people: cast  out of my sight, and let them go forth.

###### 2 
And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the ; Such as  for death, to death; and such as  for the sword, to the sword; and such as  for the famine, to the famine; and such as  for the captivity, to the captivity.

###### 3 
And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the : the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

###### 4 
And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for  which he did in Jerusalem.

###### 5 
For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

###### 6 
Thou hast forsaken me, saith the , thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.

###### 7 
And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave  of children, I will destroy my people,  they return not from their ways.

###### 8 
Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused  to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

###### 9 
She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while  yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the .

###### 10 
Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury;  every one of them doth curse me.

###### 11 
The  said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee  in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.

###### 12 
Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

###### 13 
Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and  for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.

###### 14 
And I will make  to pass with thine enemies into a land  thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger,  shall burn upon you.

###### 15 
O , thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

###### 16 
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O  God of hosts.

###### 17 
I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.

###### 18 
Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable,  refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar,  waters  fail?

###### 19 
Therefore thus saith the , If thou return, then will I bring thee again,  thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

###### 20 
And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I  with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the .

###### 21 
And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
