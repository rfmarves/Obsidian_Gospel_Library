__Summary__
Learn not the way of other nations—Their gods are idols and molten images—The Lord is the true and living God.

###### 1 
Hear ye the word which the  speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:

###### 2 
Thus saith the , Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.

###### 3 
For the customs of the people  vain: for  cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.

###### 4 
They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.

###### 5 
They  upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also  in them to do good.

###### 6 
Forasmuch as  none like unto thee, O ; thou  great, and thy name  great in might.

###### 7 
Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise  of the nations, and in all their kingdoms,  none like unto thee.

###### 8 
But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock  a doctrine of vanities.

###### 9 
Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple  their clothing: they  all the work of cunning 

###### 10 
But the   the true God, he  the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

###### 11 
Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,  they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.

###### 12 
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.

###### 13 
When he uttereth his voice,  a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

###### 14 
Every man is brutish in  knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image  falsehood, and  no breath in them.

###### 15 
They  vanity,  the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.

###### 16 
The portion of Jacob  not like them: for he  the former of all  and Israel  the rod of his inheritance: The  of hosts  his name.

###### 17 
Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.

###### 18 
For thus saith the , Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find 

###### 19 
Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this  a grief, and I must bear it.

###### 20 
My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they  not:  none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

###### 21 
For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the : therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

###### 22 
Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate,  a den of dragons.

###### 23 
O , I know that the way of man  not in himself:  not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

###### 24 
O , correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.

###### 25 
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
