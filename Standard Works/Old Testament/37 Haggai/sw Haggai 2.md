Haggai speaks about the Messiah—The Desire of All Nations will come—The Lord will give peace in His temple.

###### 1 
In the seventh  in the one and twentieth  of the month, came the word of the  by the prophet Haggai, saying,

###### 2 
Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,

###### 3 
Who  left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now?  not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?

###### 4 
Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the ; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the , and work: for I  with you, saith the  of hosts:

###### 5 
 the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

###### 6 
For thus saith the  of hosts; Yet once, it  a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry 

###### 7 
And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the  of hosts.

###### 8 
The silver  mine, and the gold  mine, saith the  of hosts.

###### 9 
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the  of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the  of hosts.

###### 10 
In the four and twentieth  of the ninth  in the second year of Darius, came the word of the  by Haggai the prophet, saying,

###### 11 
Thus saith the  of hosts; Ask now the priests  the law, saying,

###### 12 
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

###### 13 
Then said Haggai, If  unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.

###### 14 
Then answered Haggai, and said, So  this people, and so  this nation before me, saith the ; and so  every work of their hands; and that which they offer there  unclean.

###### 15 
And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the :

###### 16 
Since those  were, when  came to an heap of twenty  there were  ten: when  came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty  out of the press, there were  twenty.

###### 17 
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye  not to me, saith the .

###### 18 
Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth  from the day that the foundation of the ’s temple was laid, consider 

###### 19 
Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless 

###### 20 
And again the word of the  came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth  of the month, saying,

###### 21 
Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;

###### 22 
And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.

###### 23 
In that day, saith the  of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the , and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the  of hosts.
