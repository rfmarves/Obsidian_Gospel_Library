> __Summary__
A song describes the beauty of the poet’s beloved.

###### 1 
Behold, thou  fair, my love; behold, thou  fair; thou  doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair  as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

###### 2 
Thy teeth  like a flock  shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none  barren among them.

###### 3 
Thy lips  like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech  comely: thy temples  like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

###### 4 
Thy neck  like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

###### 5 
Thy two breasts  like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

###### 6 
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

###### 7 
Thou  all fair, my love;  no spot in thee.

###### 8 
Come with me from Lebanon,  spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

###### 9 
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,  spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

###### 10 
How fair is thy love, my sister,  spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

###### 11 
Thy lips, O  spouse, drop  the honeycomb: honey and milk  under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments  like the smell of Lebanon.

###### 12 
A garden inclosed  my sister,  spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

###### 13 
Thy plants  an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

###### 14 
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

###### 15 
A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.

###### 16 
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,  the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
