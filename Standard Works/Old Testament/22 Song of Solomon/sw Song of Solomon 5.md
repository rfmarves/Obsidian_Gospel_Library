> __Summary__
The song of love and affection continues.

###### 1 
I am come into my garden, my sister,  spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

###### 2 
I sleep, but my heart waketh:  the voice of my beloved that knocketh,  Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,  my locks with the drops of the night.

###### 3 
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

###### 4 
My beloved put in his hand by the hole  and my bowels were moved for him.

###### 5 
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped  myrrh, and my fingers  sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

###### 6 
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,  was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

###### 7 
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

###### 8 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I  sick of love.

###### 9 
What  thy beloved more than  beloved, O thou fairest among women? what  thy beloved more than  beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

###### 10 
My beloved  white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

###### 11 
His head  the most fine gold, his locks  bushy,  black as a raven.

###### 12 
His eyes  as  of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk,  fitly set.

###### 13 
His cheeks  as a bed of spices,  sweet flowers: his lips  lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

###### 14 
His hands  gold rings set with the beryl: his belly  bright ivory overlaid  sapphires.

###### 15 
His legs  pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance  as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

###### 16 
His mouth  most sweet: yea, he  altogether lovely. This  my beloved, and this  my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
