> __Summary__
The song of love continues.

###### 1 
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

###### 2 
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

###### 3 
I  my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved  mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

###### 4 
Thou  beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as  with banners.

###### 5 
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair  as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

###### 6 
Thy teeth  as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and  not one barren among them.

###### 7 
As a piece of a pomegranate  thy temples within thy locks.

###### 8 
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

###### 9 
My dove, my undefiled is  one; she  the  one of her mother, she  the choice  of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her;  the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

###### 10 
Who  she  looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,  terrible as  with banners?

###### 11 
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley,  to see whether the vine flourished,  the pomegranates budded.

###### 12 
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me  the chariots of Amminadib.

###### 13 
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
