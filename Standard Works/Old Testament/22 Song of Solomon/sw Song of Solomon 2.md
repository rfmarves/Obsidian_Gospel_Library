__Summary__
Beloved ones are praised and described.

---
###### 1 
I  the rose of Sharon,  the lily of the valleys.

###### 2 
As the lily among thorns, so  my love among the daughters.

###### 3 
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so  my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit  sweet to my taste.

###### 4 
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me  love.

###### 5 
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I  sick of love.

###### 6 
His left hand  under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

###### 7 
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake  love, till he please.

###### 8 
The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

###### 9 
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.

###### 10 
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

###### 11 
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over  gone;

###### 12 
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing  is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

###### 13 
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines  the tender grape give a  smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

###### 14 
O my dove,  in the clefts of the rock, in the secret  of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet  thy voice, and thy countenance  comely.

###### 15 
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines  tender grapes.

###### 16 
My beloved  mine, and I  his: he feedeth among the lilies.

###### 17 
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
