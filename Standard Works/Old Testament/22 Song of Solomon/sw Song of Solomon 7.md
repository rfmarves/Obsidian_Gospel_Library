> __Summary__
The song of love continues.

###### 1 
How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs  like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.

###### 2 
Thy navel  a round goblet,  wanteth not liquor: thy belly  an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

###### 3 
Thy two breasts  like two young roes  twins.

###### 4 
Thy neck  as a tower of ivory; thine eyes  the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose  as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

###### 5 
Thine head upon thee  like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king  held in the galleries.

###### 6 
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

###### 7 
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters 

###### 8 
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

###### 9 
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth  sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.

###### 10 
I  my beloved’s, and his desire  toward me.

###### 11 
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.

###### 12 
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish,  the tender grape appear,  the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

###### 13 
The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates  all manner of pleasant  new and old,  I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
