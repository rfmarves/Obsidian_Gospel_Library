The poet sings of love and devotion.

###### 1 
The song of songs, which  Solomon’s.

###### 2 
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love  better than wine.

###### 3 
Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name  ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

###### 4 
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

###### 5 
I  black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

###### 6 
Look not upon me, because I  black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards;  mine own vineyard have I not kept.

###### 7 
Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest  to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

###### 8 
If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.

###### 9 
I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.

###### 10 
Thy cheeks are comely with rows  thy neck with chains 

###### 11 
We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

###### 12 
While the king  at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.

###### 13 
A bundle of myrrh  my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.

###### 14 
My beloved  unto me  a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.

###### 15 
Behold, thou  fair, my love; behold, thou  fair; thou  doves’ eyes.

###### 16 
Behold, thou  fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed  green.

###### 17 
The beams of our house  cedar,  our rafters of fir.
