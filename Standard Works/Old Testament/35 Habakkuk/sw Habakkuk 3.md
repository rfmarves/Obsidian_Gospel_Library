> __Summary__
In his prayer Habakkuk trembles at the majesty of God.

###### 1 
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

###### 2 
O , I have heard thy speech,  was afraid: O , revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

###### 3 
God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. . His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

###### 4 
And  brightness was as the light; he had horns  out of his hand: and there  the hiding of his power.

###### 5 
Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.

###### 6 
He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways  everlasting.

###### 7 
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:  the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.

###### 8 
Was the  displeased against the rivers?  thine anger against the rivers?  thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses  thy chariots of salvation?

###### 9 
Thy bow was made quite naked,  to the oaths of the tribes,  word. . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

###### 10 
The mountains saw thee,  they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice,  lifted up his hands on high.

###### 11 
The sun  moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went,  at the shining of thy glittering spear.

###### 12 
Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.

###### 13 
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,  for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. .

###### 14 
Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing  as to devour the poor secretly.

###### 15 
Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,  the heap of great waters.

###### 16 
When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.

###### 17 
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither  fruit  in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and  no herd in the stalls:

###### 18 
Yet I will rejoice in the , I will joy in the God of my salvation.

###### 19 
The  God  my strength, and he will make my feet like hindsâ€™  and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
