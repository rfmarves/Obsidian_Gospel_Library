> __Summary__
When Habakkuk learns that the Lord will raise up the Chaldeans to overrun the land of Israel, he is troubled that the wicked can be thus employed.

###### 1 
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

###### 2 
O , how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!  cry out unto thee  violence, and thou wilt not save!

###### 3 
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause  to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence  before me: and there are  raise up strife and contention.

###### 4 
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

###### 5 
Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for  will work a work in your days,  ye will not believe, though it be told 

###### 6 
For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,  bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces  not theirs.

###### 7 
They  terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.

###### 8 
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle  hasteth to eat.

###### 9 
They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up  the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.

###### 10 
And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.

###### 11 
Then shall  mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend,  this his power unto his god.

###### 12 
 thou not from everlasting, O  my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O , thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.

###### 13 
 of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,  holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth  more righteous than he?

###### 14 
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things,  no ruler over them?

###### 15 
They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.

###### 16 
Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion  fat, and their meat plenteous.

###### 17 
Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
