> __Summary__
The Lord will pour out judgments upon Moab, Judah, and Israel for their unrighteousness.

###### 1 
Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away  thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

###### 2 
But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting,  with the sound of the trumpet:

###### 3 
And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the .

###### 4 
Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away  thereof; because they have despised the law of the , and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:

###### 5 
But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

###### 6 
Thus saith the ; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away  thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;

###### 7 
That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the  maid, to profane my holy name:

###### 8

###### 9 
Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height  like the height of the cedars, and he  strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

###### 10 
Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.

###### 11 
And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.  not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the .

###### 12 
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

###### 13 
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed  full of sheaves.

###### 14 
Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:

###### 15 
Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and  swift of foot shall not deliver  neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.

###### 16 
And  courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the .
