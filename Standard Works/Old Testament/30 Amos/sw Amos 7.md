__Summary__
Amos relates how he was called of God to be a prophet—He prophesies the captivity of Israel.

---
###### 1 
Thus hath the Lord  shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo,  the latter growth after the king’s mowings.

###### 2 
And it came to pass,  when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord , forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he  small.

###### 3 
The  repented for this: It shall not be, saith the .

###### 4 
Thus hath the Lord  shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord  called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.

###### 5 
Then said I, O Lord , cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he  small.

###### 6 
The  repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord .

###### 7 
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall  by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

###### 8 
And the  said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:

###### 9 
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

###### 10 
Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.

###### 11 
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

###### 12 
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:

###### 13 
But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it  the king’s chapel, and it  the king’s court.

###### 14 
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I  no prophet, neither  I a prophet’s son; but I  an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:

###### 15 
And the  took me as I followed the flock, and the  said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

###### 16 
Now therefore hear thou the word of the : Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not  against the house of Isaac.

###### 17 
Therefore thus saith the ; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
