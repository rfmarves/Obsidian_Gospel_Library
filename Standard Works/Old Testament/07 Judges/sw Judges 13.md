> __Summary__
Israel is in Philistine bondage for forty years—An angel comes to Manoah’s wife and promises a son who will begin to deliver Israel—The angel comes again; he ascends in a flame from the altar—Samson is born, and the Spirit of the Lord moves upon him.

###### 1 
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the ; and the  delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.

###### 2 
And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name  Manoah; and his wife  barren, and bare not.

###### 3 
And the angel of the  appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou  barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

###### 4 
Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean 

###### 5 
For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.

###### 6 
Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance  like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he  neither told he me his name:

###### 7 
But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean  for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.

###### 8 
Then Manoah entreated the , and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

###### 9 
And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband  not with her.

###### 10 
And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the  day.

###### 11 
And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him,  thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I 

###### 12 
And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and  shall we do unto him?

###### 13 
And the angel of the  said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.

###### 14 
She may not eat of any  that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean  all that I commanded her let her observe.

###### 15 
And Manoah said unto the angel of the , I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

###### 16 
And the angel of the  said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the . For Manoah knew not that he  an angel of the .

###### 17 
And Manoah said unto the angel of the , What  thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

###### 18 
And the angel of the  said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it  secret?

###### 19 
So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered  upon a rock unto the : and  did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.

###### 20 
For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the  ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on  and fell on their faces to the ground.

###### 21 
But the angel of the  did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he  an angel of the .

###### 22 
And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.

###### 23 
But his wife said unto him, If the  were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these  nor would as at this time have told us  as these.

###### 24 
And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the  blessed him.

###### 25 
And the Spirit of the  began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
