__Summary__
Jonah is displeased with the Lord for His mercy upon the peopleâ€”The Lord rebukes him.

---
###### 1 
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

###### 2 
And he prayed unto the , and said, I pray thee, O ,  not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou  a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

###### 3 
Therefore now, O , take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for  better for me to die than to live.

###### 4 
Then said the , Doest thou well to be angry?

###### 5 
So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

###### 6 
And the  God prepared a gourd, and made  to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

###### 7 
But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.

###### 8 
And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,  better for me to die than to live.

###### 9 
And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry,  unto death.

###### 10 
Then said the , Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:

###### 11 
And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and  much cattle?
