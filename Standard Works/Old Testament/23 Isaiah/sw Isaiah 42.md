---
###### 1 
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect,  my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

###### 2 
He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

###### 3 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

###### 4 
He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

###### 5 
Thus saith God the , he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

###### 6 
I the  have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

###### 7 
To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison,  them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

###### 8 
I  the : that  my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

###### 9 
Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

###### 10 
Sing unto the  a new song,  his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

###### 11 
Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up  the villages  Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

###### 12 
Let them give glory unto the , and declare his praise in the islands.

###### 13 
The  shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

###### 14 
I have long time holden my peace; I have been still,  refrained myself:  will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

###### 15 
I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

###### 16 
And I will bring the blind by a way  they knew not; I will lead them in paths  they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

###### 17 
They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye  our gods.

###### 18 
Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

###### 19 
Who  blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger  I sent? who  blind as  perfect, and blind as the ’s servant?

###### 20 
Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

###### 21 
The  is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make  honourable.

###### 22 
But this  a people robbed and spoiled;  all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

###### 23 
Who among you will give ear to this?  will hearken and hear for the time to come?

###### 24 
Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the , he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

###### 25 
Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid  not to heart.
