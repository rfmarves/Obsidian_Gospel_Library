###### 10 
All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

###### 11 
Thy pomp is brought down to the grave,  the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

###### 12 
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!  art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

###### 13 
For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

###### 14 
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.

###### 15 
Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

###### 16 
They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee,  consider thee,  this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;

###### 17 
 made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof;  opened not the house of his prisoners?

###### 18 
All the kings of the nations,  all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.

###### 20 
Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land,  slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.

###### 21

For I will rise up against them, saith the  of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the .

I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the  of hosts.

###### 24 
The  of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed,  shall it stand:

###### 25 
That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

###### 26 
This  the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this  the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

###### 27 
For the  of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul  and his hand  stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

###### 28 
In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

###### 29 
Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit  a fiery flying serpent.

###### 30 
And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.

###### 31 
Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina,  dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none  alone in his appointed times.

###### 32 
What shall  then answer the messengers of the nation? That the  hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
