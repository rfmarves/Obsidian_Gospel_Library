> __Summary__
The Lord’s Spirit will be poured out on the descendants of Israel—Idols of wood are as fuel for a fire—The Lord will gather, bless, and redeem Israel and rebuild Jerusalem.

###### 1 
Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:

###### 2 
Thus saith the  that made thee, and formed thee from the womb,  will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

###### 3 
For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:

###### 4 
And they shall spring up  among the grass, as willows by the water courses.

###### 5 
One shall say, I  the ’s; and another shall call  by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe  his hand unto the , and surname  by the name of Israel.

###### 6 
Thus saith the  the King of Israel, and his redeemer the  of hosts; I  the first, and I  the last; and beside me  no God.

###### 7 
And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.

###### 8 
Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared  ye  even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea,  no God; I know not 

###### 9 
They that make a graven image  all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they  their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.

###### 10 
Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image  is profitable for nothing?

###### 11 
Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they  of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up;  they shall fear,  they shall be ashamed together.

###### 12 
The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

###### 13 
The carpenter stretcheth out  rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

###### 14 
He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish 

###### 15 
Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth  and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth  he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.

###### 16 
He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth  and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:

###### 17 
And the residue thereof he maketh a god,  his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth  and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou  my god.

###### 18 
They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see;  their hearts, that they cannot understand.

###### 19 
And none considereth in his heart, neither  knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten  and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?

###### 20 
He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say,  not a lie in my right hand?

###### 21 
Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou  my servant: I have formed thee; thou  my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.

###### 22 
I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

###### 23 
Sing, O ye heavens; for the  hath done  shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the  hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

###### 24 
Thus saith the , thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I  the  that maketh all  that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;

###### 25 
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise  backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;

###### 26 
That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

###### 27 
That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

###### 28 
That saith of Cyrus,  my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
