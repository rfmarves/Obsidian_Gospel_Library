> __Summary__
The true law of the fast, with its purposes and attendant blessings, is set forth—The commandment to keep the Sabbath is given.

###### 1 
Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.

###### 2 
Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.

###### 3 
Wherefore have we fasted,  and thou seest not?  have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.

###### 4 
Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as  day, to make your voice to be heard on high.

###### 5

###### 11 
And the  shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.

###### 12 
And  of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

###### 13 
If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,  doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the , honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking  words:

###### 14
