What mean ye  ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord  of hosts.

###### 16 
Moreover the  saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing  they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

###### 26 
And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she  desolate shall sit upon the ground.
