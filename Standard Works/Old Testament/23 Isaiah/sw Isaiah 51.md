###### 1 
Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the : look unto the rock  ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit  ye are digged.

###### 2 
Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah  bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

###### 3 
For the  shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the ; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

###### 4 
Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.

###### 5 
My righteousness  near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.

###### 6 
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

###### 7 
Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart  my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

###### 8 
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

###### 9 
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the ; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old.  thou not it that hath cut Rahab,  wounded the dragon?

###### 10 
 thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?

###### 11 
Therefore the redeemed of the  shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy  upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy;  sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

###### 12 
I,  I,  he that comforteth you: who  thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man  shall die, and of the son of man  shall be made  grass;

###### 13 
And forgettest the  thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where  the fury of the oppressor?

###### 14 
The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

###### 15 
But I  the  thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The  of hosts  his name.

###### 16 
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou  my people.

###### 17 
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the  the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling,  wrung  out.

###### 18 
 none to guide her among all the sons  she hath brought forth; neither  that taketh her by the hand of all the sons  she hath brought up.

###### 19 
These two  are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

###### 20 
Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the , the rebuke of thy God.

###### 21 
Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:

###### 22 
Thus saith thy Lord the , and thy God  pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling,  the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:

###### 23 
But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
