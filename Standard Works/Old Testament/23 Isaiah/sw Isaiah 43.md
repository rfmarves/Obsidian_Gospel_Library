__Summary__
To Israel the Lord says, I am your God; I will gather your descendants; beside me there is no Savior; you are my witnesses.

---
###### 1 
But now thus saith the  that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called  by thy name; thou  mine.

###### 2 
When thou passest through the waters, I  with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

###### 3 
For I  the  thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt  thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.

###### 4 
Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.

###### 5 
Fear not: for I  with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;

###### 6 
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;

###### 7 
 every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

###### 8 
Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.

###### 9 
Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say,  truth.

###### 10 
Ye  my witnesses, saith the , and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I  he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.

###### 11 
I,  I,  the ; and beside me  no saviour.

###### 12 
I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when  no strange  among you: therefore ye  my witnesses, saith the , that I  God.

###### 13 
Yea, before the day  I  he; and  none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

###### 14 
Thus saith the , your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry  in the ships.

###### 15 
I  the , your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.

###### 16 
Thus saith the , which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;

###### 17 
Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

###### 18 
Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.

###### 19 
Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness,  rivers in the desert.

###### 20 
The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness,  rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

###### 21 
This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.

###### 22 
But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.

###### 23 
Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.

###### 24 
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

###### 25 
I,  I,  he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

###### 26 
Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.

###### 27 
Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.

###### 28 
Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
