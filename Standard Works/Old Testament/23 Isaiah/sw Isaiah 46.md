> __Summary__
Idols are not to be compared with the Lordâ€”He alone is God and will save Israel.

###### 1 
Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages  heavy loaden;  a burden to the weary 

###### 2 
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

###### 3 
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne  from the belly, which are carried from the womb:

###### 4 
And  to  old age I  he; and  to hoar hairs will I carry  I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver 

###### 5 
To whom will ye liken me, and make  equal, and compare me, that we may be like?

###### 6 
They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance,  hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.

###### 7 
They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea,  shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

###### 8 
Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring  again to mind, O ye transgressors.

###### 9 
Remember the former things of old: for I  God, and  none else;  God, and  none like me,

###### 10 
Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times  that are not  done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

###### 11 
Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken  I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed  I will also do it.

###### 12 
Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that  far from righteousness:

###### 13 
I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
