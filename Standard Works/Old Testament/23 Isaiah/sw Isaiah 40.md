> __Summary__
Isaiah speaks about the Messiah—Prepare ye the way of the Lord—He will feed His flock like a shepherd—Israel’s God is incomparably great.

###### 1 
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

###### 2 
Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the ’s hand double for all her sins.

###### 3 
The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the , make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

###### 4 
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:

###### 5 
And the glory of the  shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see  together: for the mouth of the  hath spoken 

###### 6 
The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh  grass, and all the goodliness thereof  as the flower of the field:

###### 7 
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the  bloweth upon it: surely the people  grass.

###### 8 
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

###### 9 
O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift  up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

###### 10 
Behold, the Lord  will come with strong  and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward  with him, and his work before him.

###### 11 
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry  in his bosom,  shall gently lead those that are with young.

###### 12 
Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

###### 13 
Who hath directed the Spirit of the , or  his counsellor hath taught him?

###### 14 
With whom took he counsel, and  instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

###### 15 
Behold, the nations  as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

###### 16 
And Lebanon  not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

###### 17 
All nations before him  as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

###### 18 
To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?

###### 19 
The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

###### 20 
He that  so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree  will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image,  shall not be moved.

###### 21 
Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

###### 22 
 he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof  as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

###### 23 
That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

###### 24 
Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

###### 25 
To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.

###### 26 
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these  that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that  strong in power; not one faileth.

###### 27 
Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the , and my judgment is passed over from my God?

###### 28 
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard,  the everlasting God, the , the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?  no searching of his understanding.

###### 29 
He giveth power to the faint; and to  no might he increaseth strength.

###### 30 
Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

###### 31 
But they that wait upon the  shall renew  strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;  they shall walk, and not faint.
