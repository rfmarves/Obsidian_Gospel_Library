__Summary__
In the day of restoration, the desert will blossom, the Lord will come, Israel will be gathered, and Zion will be built up.

---
###### 1 
The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

###### 2 
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the ,  the excellency of our God.

###### 3 
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

###### 4 
Say to them  of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come  vengeance,  God  a recompence; he will come and save you.

###### 5 
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

###### 6 
Then shall the lame  leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.

###### 7 
And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay,  grass with reeds and rushes.

###### 8 
And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it  for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err 

###### 9 
No lion shall be there, nor  ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk 

###### 10 
And the ransomed of the  shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
