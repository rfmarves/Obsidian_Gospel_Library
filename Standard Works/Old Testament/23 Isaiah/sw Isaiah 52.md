###### 4 
For thus saith the Lord , My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.

###### 5

Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean  go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the .

###### 12 
For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the  will go before you; and the God of Israel  your rearward.

###### 13 
Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.

###### 14 
As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

###### 15 
So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for  which had not been told them shall they see; and  which they had not heard shall they consider.
