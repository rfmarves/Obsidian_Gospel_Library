###### 1 
Sing, O barren, thou  didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou  didst not travail with child: for more  the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the .

###### 2 
Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;

###### 3 
For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.

###### 4 
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.

###### 5 
For thy Maker  thine husband; the  of hosts  his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.

###### 6 
For the  hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.

###### 7 
For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.

###### 8 
In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the  thy Redeemer.

###### 9 
For this  the waters of Noah unto me: for  I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.

###### 10 
For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the  that hath mercy on thee.

###### 11 
O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest,  not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

###### 12 
And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

###### 13 
And all thy children  taught of the ; and great  the peace of thy children.

###### 14 
In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.

###### 15 
Behold, they shall surely gather together,  not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.

###### 16 
Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

###### 17 
No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue  shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This  the heritage of the servants of the , and their righteousness  of me, saith the .
