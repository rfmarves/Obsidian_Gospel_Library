Trust in the Lord forever—Jehovah will die and be resurrected—All men will rise in the Resurrection.

###### 1 
In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will  appoint  walls and bulwarks.

###### 2 
Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.

###### 3 
Thou wilt keep  in perfect peace,  mind  stayed  because he trusteth in thee.

###### 4 
Trust ye in the  for ever: for in the    everlasting strength:

###### 5 
For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low,  to the ground; he bringeth it  to the dust.

###### 6 
The foot shall tread it down,  the feet of the poor,  the steps of the needy.

###### 7 
The way of the just  uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.

###### 8 
Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O , have we waited for thee; the desire of  soul  to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.

###### 9 
With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments  in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.

###### 10 
Let favour be shewed to the wicked,  will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the .

###### 11 
,  thy hand is lifted up, they will not see:  they shall see, and be ashamed for  envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

###### 12 
, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.

###### 13 
O  our God,  lords beside thee have had dominion over us:  by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

###### 14 
 dead, they shall not live;  deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.

###### 15 
Thou hast increased the nation, O , thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed  far  all the ends of the earth.

###### 16 
, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer  thy chastening  upon them.

###### 17 
Like as a woman with child,  draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain,  crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O .

###### 18 
We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

###### 19 
Thy dead  shall live,  my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew  the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

###### 20 
Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.

###### 21 
For, behold, the  cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
