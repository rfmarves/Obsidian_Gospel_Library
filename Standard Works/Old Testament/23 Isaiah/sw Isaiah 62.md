> __Summary__
In the last days, Israel will be gathered—Zion will be established—Her watchmen will teach about the Lord—The gospel standard will be lifted up—The people will be called holy, the redeemed of the Lord.

###### 1 
For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp  burneth.

###### 2 
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the  shall name.

###### 3 
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

###### 4 
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the  delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.

###### 5 
For  a young man marrieth a virgin,  shall thy sons marry thee: and  the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,  shall thy God rejoice over thee.

###### 6 
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem,  shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the , keep not silence,

###### 7 
And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

###### 8 
The  hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn  meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:

###### 9 
But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.

###### 10 
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.

###### 11 
Behold, the  hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward  with him, and his work before him.

###### 12 
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the : and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
