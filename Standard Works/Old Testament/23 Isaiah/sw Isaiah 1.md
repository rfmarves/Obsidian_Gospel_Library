> __Summary__
The people of Israel are apostate, rebellious, and corrupt; only a few remain faithful—The people’s sacrifices and feasts are rejected—They are called upon to repent and work righteousness—Zion will be redeemed in the day of restoration.

###### 1 
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,  Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

###### 2 
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the  hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.

###### 3 
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib:  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

###### 4 
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.

###### 5 
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

###### 6 
From the sole of the foot even unto the head  no soundness in it;  wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.

###### 7 
Your country  desolate, your cities  burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

###### 8 
And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

###### 9 
Except the  of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom,  we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

###### 10 
Hear the word of the , ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

###### 11 
To what purpose  the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

###### 12 
When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?

###### 13 
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

###### 14 
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear 

###### 15 
And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.

###### 16 
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

###### 17 
Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.

###### 18 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the : though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

###### 19 
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:

###### 20 
But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the  hath spoken 

###### 21 
How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

###### 22 
Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

###### 23 
Thy princes  rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.

###### 24 
Therefore saith the Lord, the  of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:

###### 25 
And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:

###### 26 
And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

###### 27 
Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.

###### 28 
And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners  together, and they that forsake the  shall be consumed.

###### 29 
For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

###### 30 
For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.

###### 31 
And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench
