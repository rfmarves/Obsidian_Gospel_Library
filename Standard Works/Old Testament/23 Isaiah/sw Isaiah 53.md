###### 1 
Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the  revealed?

###### 2 
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him,  no beauty that we should desire him.

###### 3 
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were  faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

###### 4 
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

###### 5 
But he  wounded for our transgressions,  bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

###### 6 
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the  hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

###### 7 
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

###### 8 
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.

###### 9 
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither  deceit in his mouth.

###### 10 
Yet it pleased the  to bruise him; he hath put  to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see  seed, he shall prolong  days, and the pleasure of the  shall prosper in his hand.

###### 11 
He shall see of the travail of his soul,  shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

###### 12 
Therefore will I divide him  with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
