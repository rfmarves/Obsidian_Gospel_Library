__Summary__
The people of the Lord pray for the Second Coming and for the salvation that will then be theirs.

###### 1 
Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

###### 2 
As  the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,  the nations may tremble at thy presence!

###### 3 
When thou didst terrible things  we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

###### 4 
For since the beginning of the world  have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,  he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

###### 5 
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,  remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.

###### 6 
But we are all as an unclean  and all our righteousnesses  as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

###### 7 
And  none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

###### 8 
But now, O , thou  our father; we  the clay, and thou our potter; and we all  the work of thy hand.

###### 9 
Be not wroth very sore, O , neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we  all thy people.

###### 10 
Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.

###### 11 
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.

###### 12 
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these  O ? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
