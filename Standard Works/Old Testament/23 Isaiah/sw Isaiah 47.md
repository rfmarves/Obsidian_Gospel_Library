> __Summary__
Babylon and Chaldea will be destroyed for their iniquitiesâ€”No one will save them.

###### 1 
Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground:  no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.

###### 2 
Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

###### 3 
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet  a man.

###### 4 
 our redeemer, the  of hosts  his name, the Holy One of Israel.

###### 5 
Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.

###### 6 
I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

###### 7 
And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever:  that thou didst not lay these  to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.

###### 8 
Therefore hear now this,  given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I  and none else beside me; I shall not sit  a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:

###### 9 
But these two  shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,  for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

###### 10 
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I  and none else beside me.

###### 11 
Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly,  thou shalt not know.

###### 12 
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.

###### 13 
Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from  that shall come upon thee.

###### 14 
Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:  not  a coal to warm at,  fire to sit before it.

###### 15 
Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,  thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
