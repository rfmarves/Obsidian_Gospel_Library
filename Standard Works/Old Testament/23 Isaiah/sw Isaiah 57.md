__Summary__
When the righteous die, they enter into peace—Mercy is promised to the penitent—There is no peace for the wicked.

---
###### 1 
The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth  to heart: and merciful men  taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil 

###### 2 
He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds,  walking  his uprightness.

###### 3 
But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.

###### 4 
Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth,  draw out the tongue?  ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,

###### 5 
Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?

###### 6 
Among the smooth  of the stream  thy portion; they, they  thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?

###### 7 
Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

###### 8 
Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered  than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee  with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest 

###### 9 
And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase  unto hell.

###### 10 
Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way;  saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.

###### 11 
And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid  to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

###### 12 
I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.

###### 13 
When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take  but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;

###### 14 
And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

###### 15 
For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name  Holy; I dwell in the high and holy  with him also  of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.

###### 16 
For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls  I have made.

###### 17 
For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.

###### 18 
I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

###### 19 
I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to  far off, and to  near, saith the ; and I will heal him.

###### 20 
But the wicked  like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

###### 21 
 no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
