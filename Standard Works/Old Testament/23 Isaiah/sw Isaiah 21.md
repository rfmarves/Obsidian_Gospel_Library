> __Summary__
Babylon is fallen, is fallen!—Other nations also are destroyed.

###### 1 
The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through;  it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.

###### 2 
A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.

###### 3 
Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing  I was dismayed at the seeing 

###### 4 
My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

###### 5

###### 11 
The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

###### 12 
The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.

###### 13 
The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

###### 14 
The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

###### 15 
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

###### 16 
For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:

###### 17 
And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the  God of Israel hath spoken
