__Summary__
The Second Coming will be a day of vengeance and also the year of the redeemed of the Lord—Then the Saints will praise the Lord and acknowledge Him as their father.

###### 1 
Who  this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this  glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.

###### 2 
Wherefore  red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?

###### 3 
I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people  none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

###### 4 
For the day of vengeance  in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.

###### 5 
And I looked, and  none to help; and I wondered that  none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

###### 6 
And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.

###### 7 
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the ,  the praises of the , according to all that the  hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.

###### 8 
For he said, Surely they  my people, children  will not lie: so he was their Saviour.

###### 9 
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

###### 10 
But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy,  he fought against them.

###### 11 
Then he remembered the days of old, Moses,  his people,  Where  he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where  he that put his holy Spirit within him?

###### 12 
That led  by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?

###### 13 
That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,  they should not stumble?

###### 14 
As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the  caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.

###### 15 
Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where  thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?

###### 16 
Doubtless thou  our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O ,  our father, our redeemer; thy name  from everlasting.

###### 17 
O , why hast thou made us to err from thy ways,  hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

###### 18 
The people of thy holiness have possessed  but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

###### 19 
We are  thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
