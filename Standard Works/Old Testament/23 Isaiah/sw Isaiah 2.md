###### 4 
And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

###### 9 
And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.

Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the , and for the glory of his majesty.

For the day of the  of hosts  upon every  proud and lofty, and upon every  lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

And upon all the cedars of Lebanon,  high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

###### 14 
And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills  lifted up,

###### 15 
And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

###### 16 
And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

###### 17 
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the  alone shall be exalted in that day.

###### 18 
And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

###### 19 
And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the , and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

###### 20

To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the , and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

###### 22 
Cease ye from man, whose breath  in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?
