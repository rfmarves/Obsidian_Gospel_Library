###### 11 
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?

###### 12 
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed,  Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which  in Telassar?

###### 13 
Where  the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

###### 14 
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the , and spread it before the .

###### 15 
And Hezekiah prayed unto the , saying,

###### 16 
O  of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest  the cherubims, thou  the God,  thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

###### 17 
Incline thine ear, O , and hear; open thine eyes, O , and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.

###### 18 
Of a truth, , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,

###### 19 
And have cast their gods into the fire: for they  no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.

###### 20 
Now therefore, O  our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou  the ,  thou only.

###### 22 
This  the word which the  hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee,  laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

###### 23 
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted  voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?  against the Holy One of Israel.

###### 24 
By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof,  the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border,  the forest of his Carmel.

###### 25 
I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

###### 26 
Hast thou not heard long ago,  I have done it;  of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities  ruinous heaps.

###### 27

###### 29

###### 30 
And this  a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat  year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

###### 31 
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

###### 32 
For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the  of hosts shall do this.

###### 33

###### 34 
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the .
