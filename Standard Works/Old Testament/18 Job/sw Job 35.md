__Summary__
Elihu contrasts the weakness of man and the power of God—Our wickedness hurts other men, and our righteousness helps them—Man should trust in the Lord.

---
###### 1 
Elihu spake moreover, and said,

###### 2 
Thinkest thou this to be right,  thou saidst, My righteousness  more than God’s?

###### 3 
For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?  What profit shall I have,  from my sin?

###### 4 
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

###### 5 
Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds  are higher than thou.

###### 6 
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or  thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

###### 7 
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?

###### 8 
Thy wickedness  a man as thou  and thy righteousness  the son of man.

###### 9 
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make  to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.

###### 10 
But none saith, Where  God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;

###### 11 
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

###### 12 
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.

###### 13 
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.

###### 14 
Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,  judgment  before him; therefore trust thou in him.

###### 15 
But now, because  not  he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth  not in great extremity:

###### 16 
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
