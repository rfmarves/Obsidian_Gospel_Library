__Summary__
Job tells of the ills that have befallen him and then testifies, I know that my Redeemer lives—Job prophesies that he will be resurrected and that in his flesh he will see God.

###### 1 
Then Job answered and said,

###### 2 
How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

###### 3 
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed  ye make yourselves strange to me.

###### 4 
And be it indeed  I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.

###### 5 
If indeed ye will magnify  against me, and plead against me my reproach:

###### 6 
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.

###### 7 
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but  no judgment.

###### 8 
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.

###### 9 
He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown  my head.

###### 10 
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.

###### 11 
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as  his enemies.

###### 12 
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.

###### 13 
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.

###### 14 
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

###### 15 
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

###### 16 
I called my servant, and he gave  no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.

###### 17 
My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children’s  of mine own body.

###### 18 
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

###### 19 
All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.

###### 20 
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.

###### 21 
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.

###### 22 
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

###### 23 
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!

###### 24 
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!

###### 25 
For I know  my redeemer liveth, and  he shall stand at the latter  upon the earth:

###### 26 
And  after my skin  destroy this  yet in my flesh shall I see God:

###### 27 
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another;  my reins be consumed within me.

###### 28 
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?

###### 29 
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath  the punishments of the sword, that ye may know  a judgment.
