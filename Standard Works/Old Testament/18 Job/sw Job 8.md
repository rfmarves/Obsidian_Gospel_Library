> __Summary__
Bildad asks, Doth God pervert judgment?—Bildad says, Our days upon earth are a shadow, and God will not cast away a perfect man.

###### 1 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

###### 2 
How long wilt thou speak these  and  the words of thy mouth  a strong wind?

###### 3 
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

###### 4 
If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;

###### 5 
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;

###### 6 
If thou  pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

###### 7 
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.

###### 8 
For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:

###### 9 
(For we  yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth  a shadow:)

###### 10 
Shall not they teach thee,  tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?

###### 11 
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

###### 12 
Whilst it  yet in his greenness,  not cut down, it withereth before any  herb.

###### 13 
So  the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:

###### 14 
Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust  a spider’s web.

###### 15 
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

###### 16 
He  green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.

###### 17 
His roots are wrapped about the heap,  seeth the place of stones.

###### 18 
If he destroy him from his place, then  shall deny him,  I have not seen thee.

###### 19 
Behold, this  the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.

###### 20 
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect  neither will he help the evil doers:

###### 21 
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

###### 22 
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
