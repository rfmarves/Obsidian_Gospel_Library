> __Summary__
The Lord points to His power in the leviathan—All things under the whole heaven are the Lord’s.

###### 1 
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord  thou lettest down?

###### 2 
Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?

###### 3 
Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft  unto thee?

###### 4 
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?

###### 5 
Wilt thou play with him as  a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

###### 6 
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?

###### 7 
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?

###### 8 
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

###### 9 
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not  be cast down even at the sight of him?

###### 10 
None  fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?

###### 11 
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay  under the whole heaven is mine.

###### 12 
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.

###### 13 
Who can discover the face of his garment?  who can come  with his double bridle?

###### 14 
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth  terrible round about.

###### 15 
 scales  pride, shut up together  a close seal.

###### 16 
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

###### 17 
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.

###### 18 
By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes  like the eyelids of the morning.

###### 19 
Out of his mouth go burning lamps,  sparks of fire leap out.

###### 20 
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as  of a seething pot or caldron.

###### 21 
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

###### 22 
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.

###### 23 
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.

###### 24 
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether 

###### 25 
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.

###### 26 
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.

###### 27 
He esteemeth iron as straw,  brass as rotten wood.

###### 28 
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

###### 29 
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

###### 30 
Sharp stones  under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.

###### 31 
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.

###### 32 
He maketh a path to shine after him;  would think the deep  hoary.

###### 33 
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

###### 34 
He beholdeth all high  he  a king over all the children of pride.
