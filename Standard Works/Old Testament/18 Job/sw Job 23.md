> __Summary__
Job seeks the Lord and asserts his own righteousnessâ€”He says, When the Lord has tried me, I will come forth as gold.

###### 1 
Then Job answered and said,

###### 2 
Even to day  my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.

###### 3 
Oh that I knew where I might find him!  I might come  to his seat!

###### 4 
I would order  cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.

###### 5 
I would know the words  he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.

###### 6 
Will he plead against me with  great power? No; but he would put  in me.

###### 7 
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.

###### 8 
Behold, I go forward, but he  not  and backward, but I cannot perceive him:

###### 9 
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold  he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see 

###### 10 
But he knoweth the way that I take:  he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.

###### 11 
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

###### 12 
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary 

###### 13 
But he  in one  and who can turn him? and  his soul desireth, even  he doeth.

###### 14 
For he performeth  appointed for me: and many such  with him.

###### 15 
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.

###### 16 
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

###### 17 
Because I was not cut off before the darkness,  hath he covered the darkness from my face.
