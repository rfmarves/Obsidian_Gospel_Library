---
###### 1 
And Job answered and said,

###### 2 
No doubt but ye  the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

###### 3 
But I have understanding as well as you; I  not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

###### 4 
I am  one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright  laughed to scorn.

###### 5 
He that is ready to slip with  feet  a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.

###### 6 
The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth 

###### 7 
But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

###### 8 
Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

###### 9 
Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the  hath wrought this?

###### 10 
In whose hand  the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.

###### 11 
Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

###### 12 
With the ancient  wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

###### 13 
With him  wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

###### 14 
Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

###### 15 
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

###### 16 
With him  strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver  his.

###### 17 
He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

###### 18 
He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

###### 19 
He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

###### 20 
He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.

###### 21 
He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.

###### 22 
He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.

###### 23 
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them 

###### 24 
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness  no way.

###### 25 
They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like  drunken
