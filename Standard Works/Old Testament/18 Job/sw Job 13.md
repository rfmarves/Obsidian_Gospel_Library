__Summary__
Job testifies of his confidence in the Lord and says, Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him, and He also will be my salvation.

---
###### 1 
Lo, mine eye hath seen all  mine ear hath heard and understood it.

###### 2 
What ye know,  do I know also: I  not inferior unto you.

###### 3 
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.

###### 4 
But ye  forgers of lies, ye  all physicians of no value.

###### 5 
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.

###### 6 
Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

###### 7 
Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

###### 8 
Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

###### 9 
Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye  mock him?

###### 10 
He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

###### 11 
Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?

###### 12 
Your remembrances  like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.

###### 13 
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what 

###### 14 
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?

###### 15 
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.

###### 16 
He also  my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.

###### 17 
Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

###### 18 
Behold now, I have ordered  cause; I know that I shall be justified.

###### 19 
Who  he  will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

###### 20 
Only do not two  unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.

###### 21 
Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.

###### 22 
Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.

###### 23 
How many  mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.

###### 24 
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

###### 25 
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?

###### 26 
For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.

###### 27 
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

###### 28 
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
