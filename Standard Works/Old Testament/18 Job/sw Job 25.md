__Summary__
Bildad bemoans the lowly state of man and classifies him as a worm.

---
###### 1 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

###### 2 
Dominion and fear  with him, he maketh peace in his high places.

###### 3 
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?

###### 4 
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean  born of a woman?

###### 5 
Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.

###### 6 
How much less man,  a worm? and the son of man,  a worm?
