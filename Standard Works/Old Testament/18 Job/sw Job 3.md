> __Summary__
Job curses the circumstances of his birthâ€”He asks, Why died I not from the womb?

###### 1 
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

###### 2 
And Job spake, and said,

###### 3 
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night  it was said, There is a man child conceived.

###### 4 
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.

###### 5 
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

###### 6 
 that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

###### 7 
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

###### 8 
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.

###### 9 
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but  none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

###### 10 
Because it shut not up the doors of my  womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.

###### 11 
Why died I not from the womb?  did I  give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?

###### 12 
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

###### 13 
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,

###### 14 
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;

###### 15 
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

###### 16 
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants  never saw light.

###### 17 
There the wicked cease  troubling; and there the weary be at rest.

###### 18 
 the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.

###### 19 
The small and great are there; and the servant  free from his master.

###### 20 
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter  soul;

###### 21 
Which long for death, but it  not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;

###### 22 
Which rejoice exceedingly,  are glad, when they can find the grave?

###### 23 
 to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

###### 24 
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.

###### 25 
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.

###### 26 
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
