__Summary__
Zophar asks, Canst thou by searching find out God?—Zophar says that the hope of the wicked will fade away as though it had died.

---
###### 1 
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

###### 2 
Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?

###### 3 
Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

###### 4 
For thou hast said, My doctrine  pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.

###### 5 
But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

###### 6 
And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that  double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee  than thine iniquity 

###### 7 
Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?

###### 8 
 as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?

###### 9 
The measure thereof  longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.

###### 10 
If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?

###### 11 
For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider 

###### 12 
For vain man would be wise, though man be born  a wild ass’s colt.

###### 13 
If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

###### 14 
If iniquity  in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

###### 15 
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:

###### 16 
Because thou shalt forget  misery,  remember  as waters  pass away:

###### 17 
And  age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

###### 18 
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig  thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

###### 19 
Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make  afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

###### 20 
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope  the giving up of the ghost.
