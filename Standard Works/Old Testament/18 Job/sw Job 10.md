__Summary__
Job is weary of life—He reasons with God about his afflictions—He asks, Why hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb?

---
###### 1 
My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

###### 2 
I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.

###### 3 
 good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?

###### 4 
Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

###### 5 
 thy days as the days of man?  thy years as man’s days,

###### 6 
That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?

###### 7 
Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and  none that can deliver out of thine hand.

###### 8 
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.

###### 9 
Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

###### 10 
Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?

###### 11 
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.

###### 12 
Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.

###### 13 
And these  hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this  with thee.

###### 14 
If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.

###### 15 
If I be wicked, woe unto me; and  I be righteous,  will I not lift up my head.  full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;

###### 16 
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

###### 17 
Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war  against me.

###### 18 
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

###### 19 
I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

###### 20 
 not my days few? cease  let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,

###### 21 
Before I go  I shall not return,  to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;

###### 22 
A land of darkness, as darkness  of the shadow of death, without any order, and  the light  as darkness.
