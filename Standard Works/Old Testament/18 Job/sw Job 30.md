__Summary__
Job is derided by the children of vile and base men—In his afflicted state, he cries to the Lord—Job says that he wept for those in trouble.

---
###### 1 
But now  younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

###### 2 
Yea, whereto  the strength of their hands  me, in whom old age was perished?

###### 3 
For want and famine  solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

###### 4 
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots  their meat.

###### 5 
They were driven forth from among  (they cried after them as  a thief;)

###### 6 
To dwell in the clifts of the valleys,  caves of the earth, and  the rocks.

###### 7 
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

###### 8 
 children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

###### 9 
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

###### 10 
They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.

###### 11 
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

###### 12 
Upon  right  rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

###### 13 
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.

###### 14 
They came  as a wide breaking in  in the desolation they rolled themselves 

###### 15 
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

###### 16 
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

###### 17 
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.

###### 18 
By the great force  is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

###### 19 
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.

###### 20 
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me 

###### 21 
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.

###### 22 
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride  and dissolvest my substance.

###### 23 
For I know  thou wilt bring me  death, and  the house appointed for all living.

###### 24 
Howbeit he will not stretch out  hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.

###### 25 
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was  my soul grieved for the poor?

###### 26 
When I looked for good, then evil came  and when I waited for light, there came darkness.

###### 27 
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.

###### 28 
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up,  I cried in the congregation.

###### 29 
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

###### 30 
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

###### 31 
My harp also is  to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
