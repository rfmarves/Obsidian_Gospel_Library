> __Summary__
The Lord challenges Job, and Job replies humbly—The Lord speaks of His power to Job—He asks, Hast thou an arm like God?—He points to His power in the behemoth.

###### 1 
Moreover the  answered Job, and said,

###### 2 
Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct  he that reproveth God, let him answer it.

###### 3 
Then Job answered the , and said,

###### 4 
Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

###### 5 
Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.

###### 6 
Then answered the  unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

###### 7 
Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

###### 8 
Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?

###### 9 
Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?

###### 10 
Deck thyself now  majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

###### 11 
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one  proud, and abase him.

###### 12 
Look on every one  proud,  bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.

###### 13 
Hide them in the dust together;  bind their faces in secret.

###### 14 
Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

###### 15 
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.

###### 16 
Lo now, his strength  in his loins, and his force  in the navel of his belly.

###### 17 
He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.

###### 18 
His bones  strong pieces of brass; his bones  like bars of iron.

###### 19 
He  the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach 

###### 20 
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.

###### 21 
He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

###### 22 
The shady trees cover him  their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

###### 23 
Behold, he drinketh up a river,  hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

###### 24 
He taketh it with his eyes:  nose pierceth through snares.
