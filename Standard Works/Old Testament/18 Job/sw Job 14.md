> __Summary__
Job testifies of the shortness of life, the certainty of death, and the guarantee of a resurrection—He asks, If a man die, will he live again?—Job answers that he will await the Lord’s call to come forth from the grave.

###### 1 
Man  born of a woman  of few days, and full of trouble.

###### 2 
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.

###### 3 
And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?

###### 4 
Who can bring a clean  out of an unclean? not one.

###### 5 
Seeing his days  determined, the number of his months  with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

###### 6 
Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.

###### 7 
For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

###### 8 
Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;

###### 9 
 through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

###### 10 
But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where  he?

###### 11 
 the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:

###### 12 
So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens  no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

###### 13 
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!

###### 14 
If a man die, shall he live  all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

###### 15 
Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.

###### 16 
For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?

###### 17 
My transgression  sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.

###### 18 
And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.

###### 19 
The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow  of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.

###### 20 
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

###### 21 
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth  not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth  not of them.

###### 22 
But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
