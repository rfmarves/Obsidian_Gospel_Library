> __Summary__
Job acknowledges the justice and greatness of God and concludes that man cannot contend against Him.

###### 1 
Then Job answered and said,

###### 2 
I know  so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?

###### 3 
If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.

###### 4 
 wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened  against him, and hath prospered?

###### 5 
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.

###### 6 
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.

###### 7 
Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.

###### 8 
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.

###### 9 
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.

###### 10 
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.

###### 11 
Lo, he goeth by me, and I see  not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.

###### 12 
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?

###### 13 
 God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.

###### 14 
How much less shall I answer him,  choose out my words  with him?

###### 15 
Whom, though I were righteous,  would I not answer,  I would make supplication to my judge.

###### 16 
If I had called, and he had answered me;  would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

###### 17 
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.

###### 18 
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.

###### 19 
If  of strength, lo,  strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time 

###### 20 
If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:  I  perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

###### 21 
 I  perfect,  would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.

###### 22 
This  one  therefore I said  He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.

###### 23 
If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

###### 24 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where,  who  he?

###### 25 
Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.

###### 26 
They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle  hasteth to the prey.

###### 27 
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort 

###### 28 
I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.

###### 29 
 I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

###### 30 
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

###### 31 
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.

###### 32 
For  not a man, as I  I should answer him,  we should come together in judgment.

###### 33 
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,  might lay his hand upon us both.

###### 34 
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:

###### 35 
 would I speak, and not fear him; but  not so with me.
