__Summary__
Job invites judgment so that God may know his integrity—If he has done ill, Job welcomes the penalties for so doing.

---
###### 1 
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?

###### 2 
For what portion of God  from above? and  inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

###### 3 
 not destruction to the wicked? and a strange  to the workers of iniquity?

###### 4 
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

###### 5 
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;

###### 6 
Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.

###### 7 
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

###### 8 
 let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.

###### 9 
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or  I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;

###### 10 
 let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.

###### 11 
For this  an heinous crime; yea, it  an iniquity  the judges.

###### 12 
For it  a fire  consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.

###### 13 
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;

###### 14 
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?

###### 15 
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?

###### 16 
If I have withheld the poor from  desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;

###### 17 
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;

###### 18 
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as  a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)

###### 19 
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;

###### 20 
If his loins have not blessed me, and  he were  warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

###### 21 
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:

###### 22 
 let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.

###### 23 
For destruction  God  a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.

###### 24 
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,  my confidence;

###### 25 
If I rejoiced because my wealth  great, and because mine hand had gotten much;

###### 26 
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking  brightness;

###### 27 
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:

###### 28 
This also  an iniquity  the judge: for I should have denied the God  above.

###### 29 
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:

###### 30 
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.

###### 31 
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

###### 32 
The stranger did not lodge in the street:  I opened my doors to the traveller.

###### 33 
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:

###### 34 
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence,  went not out of the door?

###### 35 
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire  the Almighty would answer me, and  mine adversary had written a book.

###### 36 
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,  bind it  a crown to me.

###### 37 
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.

###### 38 
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;

###### 39 
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

###### 40 
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
