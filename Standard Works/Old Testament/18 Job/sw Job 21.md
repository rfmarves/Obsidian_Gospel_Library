> __Summary__
Job admits that the wicked sometimes prosper in this lifeâ€”Then he testifies that their judgment will be hereafter in the day of wrath and destruction.

###### 1 
But Job answered and said,

###### 2 
Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

###### 3 
Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

###### 4 
As for me,  my complaint to man? and if  why should not my spirit be troubled?

###### 5 
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay  hand upon  mouth.

###### 6 
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.

###### 7 
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

###### 8 
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.

###### 9 
Their houses  safe from fear, neither  the rod of God upon them.

###### 10 
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

###### 11 
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

###### 12 
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.

###### 13 
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.

###### 14 
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

###### 15 
What  the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

###### 16 
Lo, their good  not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

###### 17 
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and  cometh their destruction upon them!  distributeth sorrows in his anger.

###### 18 
They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.

###### 19 
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know 

###### 20 
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

###### 21 
For what pleasure  he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?

###### 22 
Shall  teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.

###### 23 
One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

###### 24 
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.

###### 25 
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.

###### 26 
They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

###### 27 
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices  ye wrongfully imagine against me.

###### 28 
For ye say, Where  the house of the prince? and where  the dwelling places of the wicked?

###### 29 
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,

###### 30 
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

###### 31 
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him  he hath done?

###### 32 
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.

###### 33 
The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as  innumerable before him.

###### 34 
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
