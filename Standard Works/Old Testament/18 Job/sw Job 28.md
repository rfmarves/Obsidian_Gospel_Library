> __Summary__
Wealth comes out of the earth—Wisdom cannot be purchased—The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.

###### 1 
Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold  they fine 

###### 2 
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass  molten  the stone.

###### 3 
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

###### 4 
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;  forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.

###### 5 
 the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.

###### 6 
The stones of it  the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.

###### 7 
 a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:

###### 8 
The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.

###### 9 
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.

###### 10 
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.

###### 11 
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and  hid bringeth he forth to light.

###### 12 
But where shall wisdom be found? and where  the place of understanding?

###### 13 
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.

###### 14 
The depth saith, It  not in me: and the sea saith,  not with me.

###### 15 
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed  the price thereof.

###### 16 
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.

###### 17 
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it  jewels of fine gold.

###### 18 
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom  above rubies.

###### 19 
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.

###### 20 
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where  the place of understanding?

###### 21 
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.

###### 22 
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.

###### 23 
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.

###### 24 
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,  seeth under the whole heaven;

###### 25 
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.

###### 26 
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:

###### 27 
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.

###### 28 
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that  wisdom; and to depart from evil  understanding.
