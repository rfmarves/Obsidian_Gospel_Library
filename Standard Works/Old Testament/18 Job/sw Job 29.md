> __Summary__
Job recalls his former prosperity and greatness—He was blessed because of his righteousness, his charity, and his good deeds.

###### 1 
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

###### 2 
Oh that I were as  months past, as  the days  God preserved me;

###### 3 
When his candle shined upon my head,  by his light I walked  darkness;

###### 4 
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God  upon my tabernacle;

###### 5 
When the Almighty  yet with me,  my children  about me;

###### 6 
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;

###### 7 
When I went out to the gate through the city,  I prepared my seat in the street!

###### 8 
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,  stood up.

###### 9 
The princes refrained talking, and laid  hand on their mouth.

###### 10 
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

###### 11 
When the ear heard  then it blessed me; and when the eye saw  it gave witness to me:

###### 12 
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and  none to help him.

###### 13 
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.

###### 14 
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment  as a robe and a diadem.

###### 15 
I was eyes to the blind, and feet  I to the lame.

###### 16 
I  a father to the poor: and the cause  I knew not I searched out.

###### 17 
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.

###### 18 
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply  days as the sand.

###### 19 
My root  spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.

###### 20 
My glory  fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

###### 21 
Unto me  gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.

###### 22 
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.

###### 23 
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide  for the latter rain.

###### 24 
 I laughed on them, they believed  not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.

###### 25 
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one  comforteth the mourners.
