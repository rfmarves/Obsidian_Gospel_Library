__Summary__
Job asserts his righteousnessâ€”When the wicked are buried in death, terrors will take hold of them.

---
###### 1 
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

###### 2 
 God liveth,  hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty,  hath vexed my soul;

###### 3 
All the while my breath  in me, and the spirit of God  in my nostrils;

###### 4 
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.

###### 5 
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.

###### 6 
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach  so long as I live.

###### 7 
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.

###### 8 
For what  the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?

###### 9 
Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

###### 10 
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?

###### 11 
I will teach you by the hand of God:  which  with the Almighty will I not conceal.

###### 12 
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen  why then are ye thus altogether vain?

###### 13 
This  the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors,  they shall receive of the Almighty.

###### 14 
If his children be multiplied,  for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

###### 15 
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.

###### 16 
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;

###### 17 
He may prepare  but the just shall put  on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.

###### 18 
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth  the keeper maketh.

###### 19 
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he  not.

###### 20 
Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.

###### 21 
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.

###### 22 
For  shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.

###### 23 
 shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
