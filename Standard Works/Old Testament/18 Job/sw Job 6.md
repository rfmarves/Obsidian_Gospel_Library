__Summary__
Job bemoans his grief—He prays that God will grant his petitions—Those who are afflicted should be pitied—How forcible are right words!

---
###### 1 
But Job answered and said,

###### 2 
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!

###### 3 
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.

###### 4 
For the arrows of the Almighty  within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.

###### 5 
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?

###### 6 
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there  taste in the white of an egg?

###### 7 
The things  my soul refused to touch  as my sorrowful meat.

###### 8 
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant  the thing that I long for!

###### 9 
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

###### 10 
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

###### 11 
What  my strength, that I should hope? and what  mine end, that I should prolong my life?

###### 12 
 my strength the strength of stones? or  my flesh of brass?

###### 13 
 not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

###### 14 
To him that is afflicted pity  from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

###### 15 
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,  as the stream of brooks they pass away;

###### 16 
Which are blackish by reason of the ice,  wherein the snow is hid:

###### 17 
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

###### 18 
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.

###### 19 
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

###### 20 
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.

###### 21 
For now ye are nothing; ye see  casting down, and are afraid.

###### 22 
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?

###### 23 
Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?

###### 24 
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

###### 25 
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

###### 26 
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate,  as wind?

###### 27 
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig  for your friend.

###### 28 
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for  evident unto you if I lie.

###### 29 
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness  in it.

###### 30 
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
