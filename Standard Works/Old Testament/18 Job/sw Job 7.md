> __Summary__
Job asks, Is there an appointed time for man on earth? What is man that Thou shouldst magnify him? Why dost Thou not pardon my transgression?

###### 1 
 not an appointed time to man upon earth?  his days also like the days of an hireling?

###### 2 
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for  his work:

###### 3 
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.

###### 4 
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

###### 5 
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.

###### 6 
My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope.

###### 7 
O remember that my life  wind: mine eye shall no more see good.

###### 8 
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no  thine eyes  upon me, and I  not.

###### 9

###### 13 
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;

###### 14 
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:

###### 15 
So that my soul chooseth strangling,  death rather than my life.

###### 16 
I loathe  I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days  vanity.

###### 17 
What  man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?

###### 18 
And  thou shouldest visit him every morning,  try him every moment?

###### 19 
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?

###### 20 
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?

###### 21 
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I  not
