> __Summary__
Elihu, in anger, answers Job and his three friends—Elihu says, There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding—He also says, Great men are not always wise.

###### 1 
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he  righteous in his own eyes.

###### 2 
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

###### 3 
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and  had condemned Job.

###### 4 
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they  elder than he.

###### 5 
When Elihu saw that  no answer in the mouth of  three men, then his wrath was kindled.

###### 6 
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I  young, and ye  very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.

###### 7 
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.

###### 8 
But  a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

###### 9 
Great men are not  wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.

###### 10 
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

###### 11 
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.

###### 12 
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold,  none of you that convinced Job,  that answered his words:

###### 13 
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.

###### 14 
Now he hath not directed  words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.

###### 15 
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.

###### 16 
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still,  answered no more;)

###### 17 
 I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.

###### 18 
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

###### 19 
Behold, my belly  as wine  hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.

###### 20 
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.

###### 21 
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.

###### 22 
For I know not to give flattering titles;  my maker would soon take me away.
