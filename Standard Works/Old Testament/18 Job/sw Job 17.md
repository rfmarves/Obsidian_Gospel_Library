> __Summary__
Job speaks of the sorrow of death and of the grave in that day when the body returns to the dust.

###### 1 
My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves  for me.

###### 2 
 not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?

###### 3 
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who  he  will strike hands with me?

###### 4 
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt 

###### 5 
He that speaketh flattery to  friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.

###### 6 
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.

###### 7 
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members  as a shadow.

###### 8 
Upright  shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.

###### 9 
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

###### 10 
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find  wise  among you.

###### 11 
My days are past, my purposes are broken off,  the thoughts of my heart.

###### 12 
They change the night into day: the light  short because of darkness.

###### 13 
If I wait, the grave  mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.

###### 14 
I have said to corruption, Thou  my father: to the worm,  my mother, and my sister.

###### 15 
And where  now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

###### 16 
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when  rest together  in the dust.
