> __Summary__
Job speaks against the wicked who oppose him—Though even his friends scorn him, he testifies that his witness is in heaven and his record is on high.

###### 1 
Then Job answered and said,

###### 2 
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters  ye all.

###### 3 
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

###### 4 
I also could speak as ye  if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.

###### 5 
 I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage 

###### 6 
Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and  I forbear, what am I eased?

###### 7 
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.

###### 8 
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles,  is a witness  and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.

###### 9 
He teareth  in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

###### 10 
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.

###### 11 
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.

###### 12 
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken  by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.

###### 13 
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

###### 14 
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.

###### 15 
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.

###### 16 
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids  the shadow of death;

###### 17 
Not for  injustice in mine hands: also my prayer  pure.

###### 18 
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.

###### 19 
Also now, behold, my witness  in heaven, and my record  on high.

###### 20 
My friends scorn me:  mine eye poureth out  unto God.

###### 21 
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man  for his neighbour!

###### 22 
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way  I shall not return.
