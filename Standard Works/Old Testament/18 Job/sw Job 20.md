> __Summary__
Zophar shows the condition of the wicked—He says, The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment.

###### 1 
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

###### 2 
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for  I make haste.

###### 3 
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.

###### 4 
Knowest thou  this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

###### 5 
That the triumphing of the wicked  short, and the joy of the hypocrite  for a moment?

###### 6 
Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;

###### 7 
 he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where  he?

###### 8 
He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

###### 9 
The eye also  saw him shall  no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.

###### 10 
His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.

###### 11 
His bones are full  of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.

###### 12 
Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,  he hide it under his tongue;

###### 13 
 he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:

###### 14 
 his meat in his bowels is turned,  the gall of asps within him.

###### 15 
He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

###### 16 
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.

###### 17 
He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.

###### 18 
That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow  down: according to  substance  the restitution  and he shall not rejoice 

###### 19 
Because he hath oppressed  hath forsaken the poor;  he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

###### 20 
Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.

###### 21 
There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.

###### 22 
In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

###### 23 
 he is about to fill his belly,  shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain  upon him while he is eating.

###### 24 
He shall flee from the iron weapon,  the bow of steel shall strike him through.

###### 25 
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors  upon him.

###### 26 
All darkness  hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.

###### 27 
The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.

###### 28 
The increase of his house shall depart,  shall flow away in the day of his wrath.

###### 29 
This  the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
