> __Summary__
Elihu says, Those who are righteous are prospered—The wicked perish and die without knowledge—Elihu praises the greatness of God.

###### 1 
Elihu also proceeded, and said,

###### 2 
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that  yet to speak on God’s behalf.

###### 3 
I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

###### 4 
For truly my words  not  false: he that is perfect in knowledge  with thee.

###### 5 
Behold, God  mighty, and despiseth not  mighty in strength  wisdom.

###### 6 
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.

###### 7 
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings  on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.

###### 8 
And if  bound in fetters,  be holden in cords of affliction;

###### 9 
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.

###### 10 
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.

###### 11 
If they obey and serve  they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

###### 12 
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.

###### 13 
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.

###### 14 
They die in youth, and their life  among the unclean.

###### 15 
He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.

###### 16 
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait  a broad place, where  no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table  full of fatness.

###### 17 
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold 

###### 18 
Because  wrath,  lest he take thee away with  stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

###### 19 
Will he esteem thy riches?  not gold, nor all the forces of strength.

###### 20 
Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

###### 21 
Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.

###### 22 
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

###### 23 
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?

###### 24 
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

###### 25 
Every man may see it; man may behold  afar off.

###### 26 
Behold, God  great, and we know  not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.

###### 27 
For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:

###### 28 
Which the clouds do drop  distil upon man abundantly.

###### 29 
Also can  understand the spreadings of the clouds,  the noise of his tabernacle?

###### 30 
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.

###### 31 
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.

###### 32 
With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it  by  that cometh betwixt.

###### 33 
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
