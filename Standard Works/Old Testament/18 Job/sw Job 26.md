> __Summary__
Job reproves Bildad’s lack of empathy—He extols the power, greatness, and strength of the Lord.

###### 1 
But Job answered and said,

###### 2 
How hast thou helped  without power?  savest thou the arm  no strength?

###### 3 
How hast thou counselled  no wisdom? and  hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

###### 4 
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?

###### 5 
Dead  are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.

###### 6 
Hell  naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

###### 7 
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,  hangeth the earth upon nothing.

###### 8 
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.

###### 9 
He holdeth back the face of his throne,  spreadeth his cloud upon it.

###### 10 
He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.

###### 11 
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

###### 12 
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.

###### 13 
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.

###### 14 
Lo, these  parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
