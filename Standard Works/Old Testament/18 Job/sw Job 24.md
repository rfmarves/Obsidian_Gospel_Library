> __Summary__
Murderers, adulterers, those who oppress the poor, and wicked people in general often go unpunished for a little while.

###### 1 
Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?

###### 2 
 remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed 

###### 3 
They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.

###### 4 
They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.

###### 5 
Behold,  wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness  food for them  for  children.

###### 6 
They reap  his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.

###### 7 
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that  no covering in the cold.

###### 8 
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.

###### 9 
They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.

###### 10 
They cause  to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf  the hungry;

###### 11 
 make oil within their walls,  tread  winepresses, and suffer thirst.

###### 12 
Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly 

###### 13 
They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

###### 14 
The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.

###### 15 
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth  face.

###### 16 
In the dark they dig through houses,  they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

###### 17 
For the morning  to them even as the shadow of death: if  know  the terrors of the shadow of death.

###### 18 
He  swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

###### 19 
Drought and heat consume the snow waters:  the grave  have sinned.

###### 20 
The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.

###### 21 
He evil entreateth the barren  beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.

###### 22 
He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no  is sure of life.

###### 23 
 it be given him  in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes  upon their ways.

###### 24 
They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all  and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.

###### 25 
And if  not  now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
