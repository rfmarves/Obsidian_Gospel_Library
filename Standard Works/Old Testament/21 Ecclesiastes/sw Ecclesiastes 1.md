> __Summary__
Everything under the sun is vanity and vexation of spiritâ€”He who increases in knowledge increases in sorrow.

###### 1 
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

###### 2 
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all  vanity.

###### 3 
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

###### 4 
 generation passeth away, and  generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.

###### 5 
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.

###### 6 
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.

###### 7 
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea  not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

###### 8 
All things  full of labour; man cannot utter  the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

###### 9 
The thing that hath been, it  which shall be; and that which is done  that which shall be done: and  no new  under the sun.

###### 10 
Is there  thing whereof it may be said, See, this  new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

###### 11 
 no remembrance of former  neither shall there be  remembrance of  that are to come with  that shall come after.

###### 12 
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

###### 13 
And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all  that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.

###### 14 
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all  vanity and vexation of spirit.

###### 15 
 crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

###### 16 
I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all  that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

###### 17 
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

###### 18 
For in much wisdom  much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
