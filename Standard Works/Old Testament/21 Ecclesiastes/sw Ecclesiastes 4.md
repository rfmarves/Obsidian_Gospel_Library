__Summary__
Oppression and evil deeds are vanity—The strength of two is better than one—Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king.

---
###### 1 
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of  oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors  power; but they had no comforter.

###### 2 
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

###### 3 
Yea, better  than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

###### 4 
Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This  also vanity and vexation of spirit.

###### 5 
The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

###### 6 
Better  an handful  quietness, than both the hands full  travail and vexation of spirit.

###### 7 
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

###### 8 
There is one  and  not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet  no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither  For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This  also vanity, yea, it  a sore travail.

###### 9 
Two  better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

###### 10 
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him  alone when he falleth; for  not another to help him up.

###### 11 
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm 

###### 12 
And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

###### 13 
Better  a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

###### 14 
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also  born in his kingdom becometh poor.

###### 15 
I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

###### 16 
 no end of all the people,  of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also  vanity and vexation of spirit.
