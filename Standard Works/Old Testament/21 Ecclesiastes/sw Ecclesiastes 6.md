> __Summary__
Unless a manâ€™s soul is filled with good, his riches, wealth, honor, and posterity are vanity.

###### 1 
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it  common among men:

###### 2 
A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this  vanity, and it  an evil disease.

###### 3 
If a man beget an hundred  and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also  he have no burial; I say,  an untimely birth  better than he.

###### 4 
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.

###### 5 
Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known  this hath more rest than the other.

###### 6 
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice  yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?

###### 7 
All the labour of man  for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.

###### 8 
For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?

###### 9 
Better  the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this  also vanity and vexation of spirit.

###### 10 
That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it  man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.

###### 11 
Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what  man the better?

###### 12 
For who knoweth what  good for man in  life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
