> __Summary__
To every thing there is a season—Whatever God does, it will be forever—God will judge the righteous and the wicked.

###### 1 
To every  a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:

###### 2 
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up  planted;

###### 3 
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;

###### 4 
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;

###### 5 
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;

###### 6 
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;

###### 7 
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;

###### 8 
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.

###### 9 
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

###### 10 
I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.

###### 11 
He hath made every  beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

###### 12 
I know that  no good in them, but for  to rejoice, and to do good in his life.

###### 13 
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it  the gift of God.

###### 14 
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth  that  should fear before him.

###### 15 
That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.

###### 16 
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,  wickedness  there; and the place of righteousness,  iniquity  there.

###### 17 
I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for  a time there for every purpose and for every work.

###### 18 
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.

###### 19 
For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all  vanity.

###### 20 
All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.

###### 21 
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

###### 22 
Wherefore I perceive that  nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that  his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
