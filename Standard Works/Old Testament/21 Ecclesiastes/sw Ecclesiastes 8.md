> __Summary__
None have power to avoid death—It will not be well with the wicked; he turns to pleasure and cannot find wisdom.

Who  as the wise  and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.

###### 2 
I  to keep the king’s commandment, and  in regard of the oath of God.

###### 3 
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

###### 4 
Where the word of a king  power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

###### 5 
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.

###### 6

###### 7 
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?

###### 15 
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

###### 16 
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also  neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

###### 17 
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek  out, yet he shall not find  yea further; though a wise  think to know  yet shall he not be able to find
