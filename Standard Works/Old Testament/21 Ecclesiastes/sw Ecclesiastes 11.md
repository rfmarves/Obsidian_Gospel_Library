__Summary__
Do good and give to them who needâ€”God will bring all men to judgment.

---
###### 1 
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.

###### 2 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.

###### 3 
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty  upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

###### 4 
He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

###### 5 
As thou knowest not what  the way of the spirit,  how the bones  in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

###### 6 
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both  alike good.

###### 7 
Truly the light  sweet, and a pleasant  for the eyes to behold the sun:

###### 8 
But if a man live many years,  rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh  vanity.

###### 9 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these  God will bring thee into judgment.

###### 10 
Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth  vanity.
