__Summary__
All the riches and wealth of the king are vanity and vexation of spirit—Wisdom is better than folly—God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to man.

---
###### 1 
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also  vanity.

###### 2 
I said of laughter,  mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

###### 3 
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what  that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

###### 4 
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:

###### 5 
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all  fruits:

###### 6 
I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:

###### 7 
I got  servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

###### 8 
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,  musical instruments, and that of all sorts.

###### 9 
So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

###### 10 
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

###### 11 
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all  vanity and vexation of spirit, and  no profit under the sun.

###### 12 
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what  the man  that cometh after the king?  that which hath been already done.

###### 13 
Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.

###### 14 
The wise man’s eyes  in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.

###### 15 
Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also  vanity.

###### 16 
For  no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now  in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise  as the fool.

###### 17 
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun  grievous unto me: for all  vanity and vexation of spirit.

###### 18 
Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

###### 19 
And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise  or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This  also vanity.

###### 20 
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.

###### 21 
For there is a man whose labour  in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it  his portion. This also  vanity and a great evil.

###### 22 
For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

###### 23 
For all his days  sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

###### 24 
 nothing better for a man,  that he should eat and drink, and  he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it  from the hand of God.

###### 25 
For who can eat, or who else can hasten  more than I?

###### 26 
For  giveth to a man that  good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to  good before God. This also  vanity and vexation of spirit.
