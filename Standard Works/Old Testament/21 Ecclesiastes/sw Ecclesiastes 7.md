__Summary__
Wisdom gives life to them that have it—All men are sinners—God has made man upright.

---
###### 1 
A good name  better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.

###### 2 
 better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that  the end of all men; and the living will lay  to his heart.

###### 3 
Sorrow  better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

###### 4 
The heart of the wise  in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools  in the house of mirth.

###### 5 
 better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.

###### 6 
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so  the laughter of the fool: this also  vanity.

###### 7 
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.

###### 8 
Better  the end of a thing than the beginning thereof:  the patient in spirit  better than the proud in spirit.

###### 9 
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

###### 10 
Say not thou, What is  that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.

###### 11 
Wisdom  good with an inheritance: and  profit to them that see the sun.

###### 12 
For wisdom  a defence,  money  a defence: but the excellency of knowledge  wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

###### 13 
Consider the work of God: for who can make  straight, which he hath made crooked?

###### 14 
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

###### 15 
All  have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just  that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked  that prolongeth  in his wickedness.

###### 16 
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

###### 17 
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?

###### 18 
 good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.

###### 19 
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty  which are in the city.

###### 20 
For  not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.

###### 21 
Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:

###### 22 
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.

###### 23 
All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it  far from me.

###### 24 
That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

###### 25 
I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason  and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness  madness:

###### 26 
And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart  snares and nets,  her hands  bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

###### 27 
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher,  one by one, to find out the account:

###### 28 
Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.

###### 29 
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
