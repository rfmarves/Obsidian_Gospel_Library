> __Summary__
God is in heaven—A fool’s voice is known by a multitude of words—Keep your vows—Riches and wealth are the gift of God.

###### 1 
Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.

###### 2 
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter  thing before God: for God  in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

###### 3 
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice  by multitude of words.

###### 4 
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for  no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

###### 5 
Better  that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

###### 6 
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it  an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

###### 7 
For in the multitude of dreams and many words  also  vanities: but fear thou God.

###### 8 
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for  higher than the highest regardeth; and  higher than they.

###### 9 
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king  is served by the field.

###### 10 
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this  also vanity.

###### 11 
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good  to the owners thereof, saving the beholding  with their eyes?

###### 12 
The sleep of a labouring man  sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

###### 13 
There is a sore evil  I have seen under the sun,  riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

###### 14 
But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and  nothing in his hand.

###### 15 
As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

###### 16 
And this also  a sore evil,  in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?

###### 17 
All his days also he eateth in darkness, and  much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

###### 18 
Behold  which I have seen:  good and comely  to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it  his portion.

###### 19 
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this  the gift of God.

###### 20 
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth  in the joy of his heart.
