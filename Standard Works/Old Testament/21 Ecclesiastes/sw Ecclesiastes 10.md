> __Summary__
A little folly destroys the reputation of the wise and honorable—The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious—A fool is full of words.

###### 1 
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour:  a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom  honour.

###### 2 
A wise man’s heart  at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.

###### 3 
Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth  and he saith to every one  he  a fool.

###### 4 
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

###### 5 
There is an evil  I have seen under the sun, as an error  proceedeth from the ruler:

###### 6 
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

###### 7 
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.

###### 8 
He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

###### 9 
Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith;  he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

###### 10 
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom  profitable to direct.

###### 11 
Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.

###### 12 
The words of a wise man’s mouth  gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.

###### 13 
The beginning of the words of his mouth  foolishness: and the end of his talk  mischievous madness.

###### 14 
A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

###### 15 
The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

###### 16 
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king  a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!

###### 17 
Blessed  thou, O land, when thy king  the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!

###### 18 
By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

###### 19 
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all 

###### 20 
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
