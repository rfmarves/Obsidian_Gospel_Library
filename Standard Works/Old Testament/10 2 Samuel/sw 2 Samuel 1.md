###### 1 
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

###### 2 
It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and  it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

###### 3 
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

###### 4 
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

###### 5 
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

###### 6 
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

###### 7 
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here  I.

###### 8 
And he said unto me, Who  thou? And I answered him, I  an Amalekite.

###### 9 
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life  yet whole in me.

###### 10 
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that  upon his head, and the bracelet that  on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

###### 11 
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that  with him:

###### 12 
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the , and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

###### 13 
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence  thou? And he answered, I  the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

###### 14 
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the ’s anointed?

###### 15 
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,  fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

###### 16 
And David said unto him, Thy blood  upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the ’s anointed.

###### 17 
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:

###### 18 
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah  the bow: behold,  written in the book of Jasher.)

###### 19 
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!

###### 20 
Tell  not in Gath, publish  not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

###### 21 
Ye mountains of Gilboa,  no dew, neither  rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,  not  anointed with oil.

###### 22 
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

###### 23 
Saul and Jonathan  lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

###### 24 
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with  delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

###### 25 
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,  slain in thine high places.

###### 26 
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

###### 27 
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
