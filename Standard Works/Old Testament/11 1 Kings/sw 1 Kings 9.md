The Lord again appears to Solomon—The Lord promises great blessings if the Israelites are obedient and great cursings if they forsake Him—Solomon reigns in splendor, levies tribute upon the non-Israelites, and builds a navy of ships.

###### 6 
 if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments  my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

And at this house,  is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the  done thus unto this land, and to this house?
