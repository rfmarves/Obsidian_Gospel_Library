> __Summary__
Jacob sends his sons to buy grain in Egypt—They bow before Joseph—He makes harsh accusations against them, imprisons Simeon, and sends them back for Benjamin.

###### 1 
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

###### 2 
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.

###### 3 
And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

###### 4 
But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

###### 5 
And the sons of Israel came to buy  among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

###### 6 
And Joseph  the governor over the land,  he  that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him  their faces to the earth.

###### 7 
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

###### 8 
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

###### 9 
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye  spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

###### 10 
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.

###### 11 
We  all one man’s sons; we  true  thy servants are no spies.

###### 12 
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

###### 13 
And they said, Thy servants  twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest  this day with our father, and one  not.

###### 14 
And Joseph said unto them, That  that I spake unto you, saying, Ye  spies:

###### 15 
Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

###### 16 
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether  truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye  spies.

###### 17 
And he put them all together into ward three days.

###### 18 
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;  I fear God:

###### 19 
If ye  true  let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

###### 20 
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

###### 21 
And they said one to another, We  verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

###### 22 
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

###### 23 
And they knew not that Joseph understood  for he spake unto them by an interpreter.

###### 24 
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

###### 25 
Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

###### 26 
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

###### 27 
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it  in his sack’s mouth.

###### 28 
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,  even in my sack: and their heart failed  and they were afraid, saying one to another, What  this  God hath done unto us?

###### 29 
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

###### 30 
The man,  the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.

###### 31 
And we said unto him, We  true  we are no spies:

###### 32 
We  twelve brethren, sons of our father; one  not, and the youngest  this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

###### 33 
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye  true  leave one of your brethren  with me, and take  the famine of your households, and be gone:

###### 34 
And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye  no spies, but  ye  true  will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

###### 35 
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money  in his sack: and when  they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

###### 36 
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved  Joseph  not, and Simeon  not, and ye will take Benjamin  all these things are against me.

###### 37 
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.

###### 38 
And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
