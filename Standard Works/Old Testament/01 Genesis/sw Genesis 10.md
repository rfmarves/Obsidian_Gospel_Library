###### 1 
Now these  the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

###### 4 
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

###### 7 
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

###### 8 
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

###### 9 
He was a mighty hunter before the : wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the .

###### 10 
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

###### 11 
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

###### 12 
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same  a great city.

###### 13 
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

###### 16 
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

###### 17 
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

###### 18 
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

###### 19 
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

###### 20 
These  the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries,  in their nations.

###### 21 
Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were  born.

The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

###### 23 
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

###### 24 
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

###### 25 
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one  Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brotherâ€™s name  Joktan.

###### 26 
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these  the sons of Joktan.

And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

###### 31 
These  the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

###### 32 
These  the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
