###### 1 
And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you  which shall befall you in the last days.

###### 2 
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.

###### 3 
Reuben, thou  my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

###### 4 
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou  he went up to my couch.

###### 5 
Simeon and Levi  brethren; instruments of cruelty  their habitations.

###### 6 
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.

###### 7 
Cursed  their anger, for  fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

###### 8 
Judah, thou  whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand  in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.

###### 9 
Judah  a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?

###### 10 
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him  the gathering of the people 

###### 11 
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:

###### 12 
His eyes  red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

###### 13 
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he  for an haven of ships; and his border  unto Zidon.

###### 14 
Issachar  a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

###### 15 
And he saw that rest  good, and the land that  pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

###### 16 
Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

###### 17 
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

###### 18 
I have waited for thy salvation, O .

###### 19 
Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

###### 20 
Out of Asher his bread  fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.

###### 21 
Naphtali  a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

###### 22 
Joseph  a fruitful bough,  a fruitful bough by a well;  branches run over the wall:

###### 23 
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot  and hated him:

###### 24 
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty  of Jacob; (from thence  the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

###### 25 
 by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:

###### 26 
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

###### 27 
Benjamin shall ravin  a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

###### 28 
All these  the twelve tribes of Israel: and this  that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.

###### 29 
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that  in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

###### 30 
In the cave that  in the field of Machpelah, which  before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

###### 31 
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

###### 32 
The purchase of the field and of the cave that  therein  from the children of Heth.

###### 33 
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
