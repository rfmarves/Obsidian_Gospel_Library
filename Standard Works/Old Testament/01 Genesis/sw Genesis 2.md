> __Summary__

###### 1 
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

###### 2 
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

###### 3 
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

###### 4 
These  the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the  God made the earth and the heavens,

###### 5 
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the  God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and  not a man to till the ground.

###### 6 
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

###### 7 
And the  God formed man  the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

###### 8 
And the  God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

###### 9 
And out of the ground made the  God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

###### 10 
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

###### 11 
The name of the first  Pison: that  it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where  gold;

###### 12 
And the gold of that land  good: there  bdellium and the onyx stone.

###### 13 
And the name of the second river  Gihon: the same  it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

###### 14 
And the name of the third river  Hiddekel: that  it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river  Euphrates.

###### 15 
And the  God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

###### 16 
And the  God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:

###### 17 
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

###### 18 
And the  God said,  not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

###### 19 
And out of the ground the  God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought  unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that  the name thereof.

###### 20 
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

###### 21 
And the  God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;

###### 22 
And the rib, which the  God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

###### 23 
And Adam said, This  now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

###### 24 
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

###### 25 
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
