###### 1 
And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

###### 2 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

###### 3 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the  kine upon the brink of the river.

###### 4 
And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

###### 5 
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

###### 6 
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.

###### 7 
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,  a dream.

###### 8 
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but  none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

###### 9 
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:

###### 10 
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house,  me and the chief baker:

###### 11 
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

###### 12 
And  there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

###### 13 
And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

###### 14 
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved  and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

###### 15 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and  none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee,  thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

###### 16 
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,  not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

###### 17 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:

###### 18 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

###### 19 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:

###### 20 
And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:

###### 21 
And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they  still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

###### 22 
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

###### 23 
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,  blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

###### 24 
And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told  unto the magicians; but  none that could declare  to me.

###### 25 
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh  one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he  about to do.

###### 26 
The seven good kine  seven years; and the seven good ears  seven years: the dream  one.

###### 27 
And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them  seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

###### 28 
This  the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God  about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

###### 29 
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

###### 30 
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

###### 31 
And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it  very grievous.

###### 32 
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice;  because the thing  established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

###### 33 
Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

###### 34 
Let Pharaoh do  and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

###### 35 
And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

###### 36 
And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.

###### 37 
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

###### 38 
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find  as this  a man in whom the Spirit of God 

###### 39 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,  none so discreet and wise as thou 

###### 40 
Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

###### 41 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

###### 42 
And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

###### 43 
And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him  over all the land of Egypt.

###### 44 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I  Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

###### 45 
And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over  the land of Egypt.

###### 46 
And Joseph  thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

###### 47 
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

###### 48 
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which  round about every city, laid he up in the same.

###### 49 
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for  without number.

###### 50 
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.

###### 51 
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,  hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.

###### 52 
And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

###### 53 
And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.

###### 54 
And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

###### 55 
And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

###### 56 
And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

###### 57 
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy  because that the famine was  sore in all lands.
