__Summary__
Abimelech desires Sarah, who is preserved by the Lord—Abraham prays for Abimelech, and the Lord blesses him and his household.

---
###### 1 
And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

###### 2 
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She  my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

###### 3 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou  a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she  a man’s wife.

###### 4 
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?

###### 5 
Said he not unto me, She  my sister? and she, even she herself said, He  my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.

###### 6 
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

###### 7 
Now therefore restore the man  wife; for he  a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore  not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that  thine.

###### 8 
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.

###### 9 
Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

###### 10 
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?

###### 11 
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God  not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.

###### 12 
And yet indeed  my sister; she  the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

###### 13 
And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This  thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He  my brother.

###### 14 
And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave  unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

###### 15 
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land  before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.

###### 16 
And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand  of silver: behold, he  to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that  with thee, and with all  thus she was reproved.

###### 17 
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare 

###### 18 
For the  had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.
