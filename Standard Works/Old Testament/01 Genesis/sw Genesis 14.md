###### 23 
That I will not  from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that  thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
