> __Summary__
If the children of Israel are obedient, they will be blessed temporally and spirituallyâ€”If they are disobedient, they will be cursed, smitten, and destroyed; diseases, plagues, and oppression will come upon them; they will serve false gods and become a byword among all nations; fierce nations will enslave them; and they will eat their own children and be scattered among all nations.

###### 14 
And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day,  the right hand, or  the left, to go after other gods to serve them.

And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray  away.

###### 32 
Thy sons and thy daughters  given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail  for them all the day long: and  no might in thine hand.

###### 33 
The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:

###### 34 
So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

###### 35 
The  shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.

The  shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

###### 37 
And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the  shall lead thee.

###### 46 
And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.

###### 47 
Because thou servedst not the  thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all

A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

###### 51 
And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which  shall not leave thee  corn, wine, or oil,  the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

###### 52 
And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the  thy God hath given thee.

###### 53 
And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the  thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:

###### 54 
 the man  tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

###### 55 
So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.

###### 56 
The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,

###### 57 
And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all  secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.

###### 58 
If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, ;

###### 59 
Then the  will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed,  great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

###### 60 
Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

###### 61 
Also every sickness, and every plague, which  not written in the book of this law, them will the  bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

###### 62 
And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the  thy God.

###### 63 
And it shall come to pass,  as the  rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the  will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

###### 64 
And the  shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,  wood and stone.

###### 65 
And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the  shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

###### 66 
And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

###### 67 
In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.

###### 68 
And the  shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy
