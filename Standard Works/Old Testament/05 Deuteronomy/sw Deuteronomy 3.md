> __Summary__
The children of Israel destroy the people of Bashan—Their lands, on the east of the Jordan, are given to Reuben and Gad—Moses sees Canaan from Pisgah but is denied entrance thereto—He counsels and strengthens Joshua.

###### 1 
Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

###### 2 
And the  said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

###### 3 
So the  our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.

###### 4 
And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

###### 5 
All these cities  fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.

###### 6 
And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

###### 7 
But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.

###### 8 
And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that  on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

###### 9 
( Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)

###### 10 
All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

###### 11 
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead  a bedstead of iron;  it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits  the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

###### 12 
And this land,  we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which  by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

###### 13 
And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan,  the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

###### 14 
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.

###### 15 
And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

###### 16 
And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok,  the border of the children of Ammon;

###### 17 
The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast  from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain,  the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.

###### 18 
And I commanded you at that time, saying, The  your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all  meet for the war.

###### 19 
But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ( I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;

###### 20 
Until the  have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and  they also possess the land which the  your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and  shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

###### 21 
And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the  your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the  do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

###### 22 
Ye shall not fear them: for the  your God he shall fight for you.

###### 23 
And I besought the  at that time, saying,

###### 24 
O Lord , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God  in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?

###### 25 
I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that  beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

###### 26 
But the  was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the  said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.

###### 27 
Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold  with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

###### 28 
But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

###### 29 
So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
