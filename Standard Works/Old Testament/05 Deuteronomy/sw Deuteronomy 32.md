__Summary__
Israel will sing the song of Moses and acclaim: God speaks to heaven and earth; the children of Israel were known in the premortal life; God chose them in this life; they forgot the Rock of their salvation; He sent terror, a sword, and vengeance upon them; there is no God beside Him—Moses will be gathered to his people.

###### 1 
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.

###### 2 
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:

###### 3 
Because I will publish the name of the : ascribe ye greatness unto our God.

###### 4 
 the Rock, his work  perfect: for all his ways  judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right  he.

###### 5 
They have corrupted themselves, their spot  not  of his children:  a perverse and crooked generation.

###### 6 
Do ye thus requite the , O foolish people and unwise?  not he thy father  hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?

For the ’s portion  his people; Jacob  the lot of his inheritance.

###### 10 
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.

###### 11 
As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:

###### 12 
 the  alone did lead him, and  no strange god with him.

###### 13 
He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

###### 14 
Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

###### 15 
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered  then he forsook God  made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

###### 16 
They provoked him to jealousy with strange  with abominations provoked they him to anger.

###### 17 
They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new  came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

###### 18 
Of the Rock  begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.

###### 19 
And when the  saw  he abhorred  because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

###### 20 
And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end  for they  a very froward generation, children in whom  no faith.

###### 21 
They have moved me to jealousy with  not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with  not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

###### 22 
For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

###### 23 
I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.

###### 24 
 burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

###### 25 
The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling  with the man of gray hairs.

###### 26 
I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:

###### 27 
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,  lest they should say, Our hand  high, and the  hath not done all this.

###### 28 
For they  a nation void of counsel, neither  understanding in them.

###### 29 
O that they were wise,  they understood this,  they would consider their latter end!

###### 30 
How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the  had shut them up?

###### 31 
For their rock  not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves  judges.

###### 32 
For their vine  of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes  grapes of gall, their clusters  bitter:

###### 33 
Their wine  the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

###### 34 
 not this laid up in store with me,  sealed up among my treasures?

###### 35 
To me  vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in  time: for the day of their calamity  at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

###### 36 
For the  shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that  power is gone, and  none shut up, or left.

###### 37 
And he shall say, Where  their gods,  rock in whom they trusted,

###### 38 
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,  drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you,  be your protection.

###### 39 
See now that I,  I,  he, and  no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither  that can deliver out of my hand.

###### 40 
For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

###### 41 
If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.

###### 42 
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh;  with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

###### 43 
Rejoice, O ye nations,  his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land,  to his people.

###### 44 
And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

###### 45 
And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

###### 46 
And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

###### 47 
For it  not a vain thing for you; because it  your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong  days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

###### 48 
And the  spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

###### 49 
Get thee up into this mountain Abarim,  mount Nebo, which  in the land of Moab, that  over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

###### 50 
And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:

###### 51 
Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

###### 52 
Yet thou shalt see the land before  but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
