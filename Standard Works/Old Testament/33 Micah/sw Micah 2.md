Arise ye, and depart; for this  not  rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy  even with a sore destruction.

###### 11 
If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,  I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.

###### 12 
I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of  men.

###### 13 
The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the  on the head of them.
