> __Summary__
Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God; beware of false prophets—He promises salvation to those who do the will of the Father—Compare Matthew 7. About A.D. 34.

###### 1 
And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.

###### 2 
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

###### 3 
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

###### 4 
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

###### 5 
Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother’s eye.

###### 6 
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

###### 7 
Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

###### 8 
For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

###### 9 
Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?

###### 10 
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

###### 11 
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

###### 12 
Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

###### 13 
Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat;

###### 14 
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

###### 15 
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

###### 16 
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

###### 17 
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

###### 18 
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

###### 19 
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

###### 20 
Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.

###### 21 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.

###### 22 
Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?

###### 23 
And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

###### 24 
Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock—

###### 25 
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.

###### 26 
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand—

###### 27 
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
