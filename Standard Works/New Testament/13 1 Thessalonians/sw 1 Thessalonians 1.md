> __Summary__
The gospel comes both in word and in power.

###### 1 
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians  in God the Father and  the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace  unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

###### 2 
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;

###### 3 
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;

###### 4 
Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

###### 5 
For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.

###### 6 
And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:

###### 7 
So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

###### 8 
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.

###### 9 
For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;

###### 10 
And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,  Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
