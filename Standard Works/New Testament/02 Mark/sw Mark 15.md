> __Summary__
Pilate decrees the death of Jesus—Jesus is mocked and crucified between two thieves—He dies and is buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathæa.

###### 1 
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried  away, and delivered  to Pilate.

###### 2 
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest 

###### 3 
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.

###### 4 
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.

###### 5 
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

###### 6 
Now at  feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.

###### 7 
And there was  named Barabbas,  bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

###### 8 
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire  as he had ever done unto them.

###### 9 
But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

###### 10 
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

###### 11 
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.

###### 12 
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do  whom ye call the King of the Jews?

###### 13 
And they cried out again, Crucify him.

###### 14 
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

###### 15 
And  Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged  to be crucified.

###### 16 
And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.

###### 17 
And they clothed him with purple, and plaited a crown of thorns, and put it about his 

###### 18 
And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

###### 19 
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing  knees worshipped him.

###### 20 
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

###### 21 
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

###### 22 
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

###### 23 
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received  not.

###### 24 
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

###### 25 
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

###### 26 
And the superscription of his accusation was written over, .

###### 27 
And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

###### 28 
And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

###### 29 
And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest  in three days,

###### 30 
Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

###### 31 
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

###### 32 
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

###### 33 
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

###### 34 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

###### 35 
And some of them that stood by, when they heard  said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

###### 36 
And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put  on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.

###### 37 
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

###### 38 
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

###### 39 
And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

###### 40 
There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

###### 41 
(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

###### 42 
And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

###### 43 
Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

###### 44 
And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling  the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

###### 45 
And when he knew  of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

###### 46 
And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

###### 47 
And Mary Magdalene and Mary  of Joses beheld where he was laid.
