> __Summary__
We should pray for all people—Christ is our Mediator—Women should dress modestly—Women are blessed in childbearing and are admonished to continue in faith, charity, and holiness.

###### 1 
I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,  giving of thanks, be made for all men;

###### 2 
For kings, and  all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

###### 3 
For this  good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

###### 4 
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

###### 5 
For  one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

###### 6 
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

###### 7 
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ,  lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

###### 8 
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

###### 9 
In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

###### 10 
But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

###### 11 
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

###### 12 
But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

###### 13 
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

###### 14 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.

###### 15 
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
