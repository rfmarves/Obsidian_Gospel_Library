> __Summary__
Counsel is given to teach true doctrine only—Christ came to save repentant sinners.

###### 1 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ,  our hope;

###### 2 
Unto Timothy,  own son in the faith: Grace, mercy,  peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

###### 3 
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

###### 4 
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: 

###### 5 
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and  a good conscience, and  faith unfeigned:

###### 6 
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

###### 7 
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

###### 8 
But we know that the law  good, if a man use it lawfully;

###### 9 
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

###### 10 
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;

###### 11 
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

###### 12 
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

###### 13 
Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did  ignorantly in unbelief.

###### 14 
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

###### 15 
This  a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

###### 16 
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

###### 17 
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,  honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

###### 18 
This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;

###### 19 
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

###### 20 
Of whom is Hymenæus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
