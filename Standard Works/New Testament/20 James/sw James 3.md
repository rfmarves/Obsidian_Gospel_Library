> __Summary__
By governing the tongue, we gain perfection—Heavenly wisdom is pure, peaceable, and full of mercy.

###### 1 
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.

###### 2 
For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same  a perfect man,  able also to bridle the whole body.

###### 3 
Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.

###### 4 
Behold also the ships, which though  so great, and  driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

###### 5 
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

###### 6 
And the tongue  a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

###### 7 
For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:

###### 8 
But the tongue can no man tame;  an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

###### 9 
Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

###### 10 
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

###### 11 
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet  and bitter?

###### 12 
Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so  no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

###### 13 
Who  a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

###### 14 
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.

###### 15 
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but  earthly, sensual, devilish.

###### 16 
For where envying and strife  there  confusion and every evil work.

###### 17 
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,  easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

###### 18 
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
