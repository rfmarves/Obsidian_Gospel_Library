> __Summary__
Paul counsels, Be subject unto God’s ministers; keep the commandments; love one another; righteousness leads to salvation.

###### 1 
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

###### 2 
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

###### 3 
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

###### 4 
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to  wrath upon him that doeth evil.

###### 5 
Wherefore  must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

###### 6 
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

###### 7 
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute  custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

###### 8 
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

###### 9 
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if  any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

###### 10 
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love  the fulfilling of the law.

###### 11 
And that, knowing the time, that now  high time to awake out of sleep: for now  our salvation nearer than when we believed.

###### 12 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

###### 13 
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

###### 14 
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to  the lusts
