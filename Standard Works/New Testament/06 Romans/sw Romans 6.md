> __Summary__
Baptism is in similitude of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ—The wages of sin is death—Christ brings eternal life.

###### 1 
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?

###### 2 
God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

###### 3 
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?

###### 4 
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

###### 5 
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also  of  resurrection:

###### 6 
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with  that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

###### 7 
For he that is dead is freed from sin.

###### 8 
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:

###### 9 
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.

###### 10 
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

###### 11 
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

###### 12 
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.

###### 13 
Neither yield ye your members  instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members  instruments of righteousness unto God.

###### 14 
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.

###### 15 
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.

###### 16 
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

###### 17 
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

###### 18 
Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.

###### 19 
I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

###### 20 
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.

###### 21 
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things  death.

###### 22 
But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

###### 23 
For the wages of sin  death; but the gift of God  eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
