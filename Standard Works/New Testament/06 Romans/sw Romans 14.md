__Summary__
Avoid quarreling about opinions and making unrighteous judgment of each other—Every knee will bow to Christ—The kingdom of God embraces righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

###### 1 
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye,  not to doubtful disputations.

###### 2 
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.

###### 3 
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

###### 4 
Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

###### 5 
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day  Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

###### 6 
He that regardeth the day, regardeth  unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard  He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

###### 7 
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

###### 8 
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.

###### 9 
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.

###### 10 
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

###### 11 
For it is written,  I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

###### 12 
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

###### 13 
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in  brother’s way.

###### 14 
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that  nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him  unclean.

###### 15 
But if thy brother be grieved with  meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

###### 16 
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

###### 17 
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

###### 18 
For he that in these things serveth Christ  acceptable to God, and approved of men.

###### 19 
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

###### 20 
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed  pure; but  evil for that man who eateth with offence.

###### 21 
 good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor  whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

###### 22 
Hast thou faith? have  to thyself before God. Happy  he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

###### 23 
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because  not of faith: for whatsoever  not of faith is sin.
