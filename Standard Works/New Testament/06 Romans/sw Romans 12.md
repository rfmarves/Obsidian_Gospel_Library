__Summary__
Paul counsels the Saints to present their bodies as a living sacrifice, to use their own grace-given gifts, and to live as Saints should live.

---
###### 1 
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,  your reasonable service.

###### 2 
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what  that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

###### 3 
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think  more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

###### 4 
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:

###### 5 
So we,  many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

###### 6 
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy,  according to the proportion of faith;

###### 7 
Or ministry,  on  ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;

###### 8 
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth,  with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

###### 9 
 love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

###### 10 
 kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

###### 11 
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

###### 12 
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;

###### 13 
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

###### 14 
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

###### 15 
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

###### 16 
 of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

###### 17 
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

###### 18 
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

###### 19 
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but  give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance  mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

###### 20 
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

###### 21 
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
