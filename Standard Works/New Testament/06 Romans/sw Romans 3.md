> __Summary__
Man is not justified by the law of Moses—He is justified through righteousness, which comes through faith in Christ, made possible through Christ’s atoning sacrifice.

###### 1 
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit  of circumcision?

###### 2 
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

###### 3 
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

###### 4 
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

###### 5 
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?  God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

###### 6 
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

###### 7 
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

###### 8 
And not  (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

###### 9 
What then? are we better  No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

###### 10 
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

###### 11 
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

###### 12 
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

###### 13 
Their throat  an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps  under their lips:

###### 14 
Whose mouth  full of cursing and bitterness:

###### 15 
Their feet  swift to shed blood:

###### 16 
Destruction and misery  in their ways:

###### 17 
And the way of peace have they not known:

###### 18 
There is no fear of God before their eyes.

###### 19 
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

###### 20 
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law  the knowledge of sin.

###### 21 
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

###### 22 
Even the righteousness of God  by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

###### 23 
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

###### 24 
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

###### 25 
Whom God hath set forth  a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

###### 26 
To declare,  at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

###### 27 
Where  boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

###### 28 
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

###### 29 
 the God of the Jews only?  not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

###### 30 
Seeing  one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

###### 31 
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
