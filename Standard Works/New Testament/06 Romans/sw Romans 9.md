> __Summary__
Paul explains how the law of election (foreordination) operates—The people of Israel are chosen (foreordained) to receive the adoption, covenants, promises, and blessings of the gospel; yet they are not all Israel who are of Israel—They must seek their blessings by faith—The Gentiles also attain to righteousness and salvation by faith.

###### 1 
I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,

###### 2 
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

###### 3 
For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

###### 4 
Who are Israelites; to whom  the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service  and the promises;

###### 5 
Whose  the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ  who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

###### 6 
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they  not all Israel, which are of Israel:

###### 7 
Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham,  all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

###### 8 
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

###### 9 
For this  the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.

###### 10 
And not only  but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,  by our father Isaac;

###### 11 
(For  being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)

###### 12 
It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

###### 13 
As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

###### 14 
What shall we say then?  unrighteousness with God? God forbid.

###### 15 
For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

###### 16 
So then  not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

###### 17 
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.

###### 18 
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will  and whom he will he hardeneth.

###### 19 
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?

###### 20 
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed  Why hast thou made me thus?

###### 21 
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

###### 22 
 if God, willing to shew  wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

###### 23 
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

###### 24 
Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

###### 25 
As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

###### 26 
And it shall come to pass,  in the place where it was said unto them, Ye  not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.

###### 27 
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

###### 28 
For he will finish the work, and cut  short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

###### 29 
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

###### 30 
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.

###### 31 
But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

###### 32 
Wherefore? Because  not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

###### 33 
As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
