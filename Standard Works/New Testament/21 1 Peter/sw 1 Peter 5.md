> __Summary__
The elders are to feed the flock of Godâ€”Humility and godly graces lead to perfection.

###### 1 
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:

###### 2 
Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight  not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;

###### 3 
Neither as being lords over  heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

###### 4 
And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

###### 5 
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all  be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

###### 6 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:

###### 7 
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

###### 8 
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

###### 9 
Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

###### 10 
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle 

###### 11 
To him  glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

###### 12 
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.

###### 13 
The  at Babylon, elected together with  saluteth you; and  Marcus my son.

###### 14 
Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace  with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
