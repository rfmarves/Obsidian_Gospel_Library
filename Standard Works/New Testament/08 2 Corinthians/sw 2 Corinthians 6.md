__Summary__
Now is the day of salvation—God’s ministers must walk uprightly and bear all things—Saints should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.

---
###### 1 
We then,  workers together  beseech  also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.

###### 2 
(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now  the accepted time; behold, now  the day of salvation.)

###### 3 
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

###### 4 
But in all  approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

###### 5 
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;

###### 6 
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,

###### 7 
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

###### 8 
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and  true;

###### 9 
As unknown, and  well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;

###### 10 
As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and  possessing all things.

###### 11 
O  Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.

###### 12 
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.

###### 13 
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto  children,) be ye also enlarged.

###### 14 
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?

###### 15 
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

###### 16 
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in  and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

###### 17 
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean  and I will receive you,

###### 18 
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
