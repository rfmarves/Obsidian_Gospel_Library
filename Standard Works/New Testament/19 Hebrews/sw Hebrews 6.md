__Summary__
Let us go on to perfection—The sons of perdition crucify Christ anew—God swears with an oath that the faithful will be saved.

---
###### 1 
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

###### 2 
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

###### 3 
And this will we do, if God permit.

###### 4 
For  impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

###### 5 
And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,

###### 6 
If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put  to an open shame.

###### 7 
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

###### 8 
But that which beareth thorns and briers  rejected, and  nigh unto cursing; whose end  to be burned.

###### 9 
But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

###### 10 
For God  not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.

###### 11 
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

###### 12 
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

###### 13 
For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,

###### 14 
Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.

###### 15 
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

###### 16 
For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation  to them an end of all strife.

###### 17 
Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed  by an oath:

###### 18 
That by two immutable things, in which  impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

###### 19 
Which  we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

###### 20 
Whither the forerunner is for us entered,  Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
