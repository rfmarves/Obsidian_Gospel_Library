> __Summary__
Christ gives eternal glory to the elect—Shun contention and seek godliness.

###### 1 
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

###### 2 
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

###### 3 
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

###### 4 
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of  life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

###### 5 
And if a man also strive for masteries,  is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

###### 6 
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

###### 7 
Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.

###### 8 
Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:

###### 9 
Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer,  unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

###### 10 
Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

###### 11 
 a faithful saying: For if we be dead with  we shall also live with 

###### 12 
If we suffer, we shall also reign with  if we deny  he also will deny us:

###### 13 
If we believe not,  he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

###### 14 
Of these things put  in remembrance, charging  before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit,  to the subverting of the hearers.

###### 15 
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

###### 16 
But shun profane  vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.

###### 17 
And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;

###### 18 
Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

###### 19 
Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

###### 20 
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.

###### 21 
If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use,  prepared unto every good work.

###### 22 
Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

###### 23 
But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

###### 24 
And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all  apt to teach, patient,

###### 25 
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

###### 26 
And  they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
