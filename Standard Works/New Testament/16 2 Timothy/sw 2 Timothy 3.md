> __Summary__
Paul describes the apostasy and perilous times of the last daysâ€”The scriptures guide man to salvation.

###### 1 
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

###### 2 
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

###### 3 
Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

###### 4 
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

###### 5 
Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

###### 6 
For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

###### 7 
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

###### 8 
Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

###### 9 
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all  as theirs also was.

###### 10 
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

###### 11 
Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of  all the Lord delivered me.

###### 12 
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

###### 13 
But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.

###### 14 
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned 

###### 15 
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

###### 16 
All scripture  given by inspiration of God, and  profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

###### 17 
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
