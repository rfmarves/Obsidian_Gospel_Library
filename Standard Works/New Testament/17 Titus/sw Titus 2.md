__Summary__
Saints should live righteously, deny ungodliness, and seek the Lord.

---
###### 1 
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

###### 2 
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

###### 3 
The aged women likewise, that  in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

###### 4 
That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

###### 5 
 discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

###### 6 
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

###### 7 
In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine  uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

###### 8 
Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

###### 9 
 servants to be obedient unto their own masters,  to please  well in all  not answering again;

###### 10 
Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

###### 11 
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,

###### 12 
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

###### 13 
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

###### 14 
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

###### 15 
These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
