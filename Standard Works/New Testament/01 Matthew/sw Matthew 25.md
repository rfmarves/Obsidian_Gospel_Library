__Summary__
Jesus gives the parables of the ten virgins, the talents, and the sheep and the goats.

---
###### 1 
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

###### 2 
And five of them were wise, and five  foolish.

###### 3 
They that  foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

###### 4 
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

###### 5 
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

###### 6 
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

###### 7 
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

###### 8 
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

###### 9 
But the wise answered, saying,  lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

###### 10 
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

###### 11 
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.

###### 12 
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

###### 13 
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

###### 14 
For  as a man travelling into a far country,  called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

###### 15 
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.

###### 16 
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made  other five talents.

###### 17 
And likewise he that  two, he also gained other two.

###### 18 
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.

###### 19 
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

###### 20 
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.

###### 21 
His lord said unto him, Well done,  good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

###### 22 
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.

###### 23 
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

###### 24 
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

###### 25 
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,  thou hast  thine.

###### 26 
His lord answered and said unto him,  wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:

###### 27 
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and  at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

###### 28 
Take therefore the talent from him, and give  unto him which hath ten talents.

###### 29 
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

###### 30 
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

###### 31 
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

###### 32 
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth  sheep from the goats:

###### 33 
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.

###### 34 
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

###### 35 
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

###### 36 
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.

###### 37 
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed  or thirsty, and gave  drink?

###### 38 
When saw we thee a stranger, and took  in? or naked, and clothed 

###### 39 
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

###### 40 
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done  unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done  unto me.

###### 41 
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

###### 42 
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:

###### 43 
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

###### 44 
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

###### 45 
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did  not to one of the least of these, ye did  not to me.

###### 46 
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
