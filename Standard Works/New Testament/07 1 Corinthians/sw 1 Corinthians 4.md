> __Summary__
Christ’s ministers must be faithful—The Apostles suffer, minister, and keep the faith—The kingdom of God is not in word but in power.

###### 1 
Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

###### 2 
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

###### 3 
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

###### 4 
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

###### 5 
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

###### 6 
And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and  Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think  above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.

###### 7 
For who maketh thee to differ  and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive  why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received 

###### 8 
Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

###### 9 
For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.

###### 10 
We  fools for Christ’s sake, but ye  wise in Christ; we  weak, but ye  strong; ye  honourable, but we  despised.

###### 11 
Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;

###### 12 
And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

###### 13 
Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world,  the offscouring of all things unto this day.

###### 14 
I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn 

###### 15 
For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet  not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

###### 16 
Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

###### 17 
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

###### 18 
Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

###### 19 
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

###### 20 
For the kingdom of God  not in word, but in power.

###### 21 
What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and  the spirit of meekness?
