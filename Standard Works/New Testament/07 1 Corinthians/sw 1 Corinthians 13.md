> __Summary__
Paul discusses the high status of charity—Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost all else.

###### 1 
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become  sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

###### 2 
And though I have  prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

###### 3 
And though I bestow all my goods to feed  and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

###### 4 
Charity suffereth long,  is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

###### 5 
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;

###### 6 
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

###### 7 
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.

###### 8 
Charity never faileth: but whether  prophecies, they shall fail; whether  tongues, they shall cease; whether  knowledge, it shall vanish away.

###### 9 
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

###### 10 
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

###### 11 
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

###### 12 
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

###### 13 
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these  charity.
