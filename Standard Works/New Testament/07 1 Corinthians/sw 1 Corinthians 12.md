> __Summary__
The Holy Ghost reveals that Jesus is the Christ—Spiritual gifts are present among the Saints—Apostles, prophets, and miracles are found in the true Church.

###### 1 
Now concerning spiritual  brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

###### 2 
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

###### 3 
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and  no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

###### 4 
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

###### 5 
And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

###### 6 
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

###### 7 
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

###### 8 
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

###### 9 
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

###### 10 
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another  kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

###### 11 
But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

###### 12 
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also  Christ.

###### 13 
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether  Jews or Gentiles, whether  bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

###### 14 
For the body is not one member, but many.

###### 15 
If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

###### 16 
And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?

###### 17 
If the whole body  an eye, where  the hearing? If the whole  hearing, where  the smelling?

###### 18 
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.

###### 19 
And if they were all one member, where  the body?

###### 20 
But now  many members, yet but one body.

###### 21 
And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

###### 22 
Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:

###### 23 
And those  of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely  have more abundant comeliness.

###### 24 
For our comely  have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that  which lacked:

###### 25 
That there should be no schism in the body; but  the members should have the same care one for another.

###### 26 
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

###### 27 
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

###### 28 
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

###### 29 
 all apostles?  all prophets?  all teachers?  all workers of miracles?

###### 30 
Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

###### 31 
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
