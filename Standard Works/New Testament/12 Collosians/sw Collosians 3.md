> __Summary__
Some lives are hidden with God in Christ—The Saints are told to be holy and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

###### 1 
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

###### 2 
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

###### 3 
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

###### 4 
When Christ,  our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

###### 5 
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

###### 6 
For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:

###### 7 
In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

###### 8 
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.

###### 9 
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;

###### 10 
And have put on the new  which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:

###### 11 
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond  free: but Christ  all, and in all.

###### 12 
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

###### 13 
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also  ye.

###### 14 
And above all these things  charity, which is the bond of perfectness.

###### 15 
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

###### 16 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

###### 17 
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed,  all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

###### 18 
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.

###### 19 
Husbands, love  wives, and be not bitter against them.

###### 20 
Children, obey  parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.

###### 21 
Fathers, provoke not your children  lest they be discouraged.

###### 22 
Servants, obey in all things  masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:

###### 23 
And whatsoever ye do, do  heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;

###### 24 
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

###### 25 
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
