> __Summary__
Being rejected by the Jews, Paul turns to the Gentiles—He preaches, ministers, and travels—Apollos also preaches with power.

###### 1 
After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

###### 2 
And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

###### 3 
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

###### 4 
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

###### 5 
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews  Jesus  Christ.

###### 6 
And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook  raiment, and said unto them, Your blood  upon your own heads; I  clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

###### 7 
And he departed thence, and entered into a certain  house, named Justus,  that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

###### 8 
And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

###### 9 
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:

###### 10 
For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.

###### 11 
And he continued  a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

###### 12 
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

###### 13 
Saying, This  persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

###### 14 
And when Paul was now about to open  mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O  Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

###### 15 
But if it be a question of words and names, and  your law, look ye  for I will be no judge of such 

###### 16 
And he drave them from the judgment seat.

###### 17 
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat  before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

###### 18 
And Paul  tarried  yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn  head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

###### 19 
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

###### 20 
When they desired  to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;

###### 21 
But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

###### 22 
And when he had landed at Cæsarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

###### 23 
And after he had spent some time  he departed, and went over  the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

###### 24 
And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man,  mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

###### 25 
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

###### 26 
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto  and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

###### 27 
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

###### 28 
For he mightily convinced the Jews,  publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
