> __Summary__
1–3, There are both resurrected and spirit bodies in heaven; 4–9, Keys are given whereby messengers from beyond the veil may be identified.

###### 1 
There are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones—

###### 2 
For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

###### 3 
Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.

###### 4 
When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.

###### 5 
If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.

###### 6 
If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear—

###### 7 
Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.

###### 8 
If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.

###### 9 
These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God.
