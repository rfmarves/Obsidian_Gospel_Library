> __Summary__
1â€“4, John Whitmer is designated to keep the history of the Church and to write for the Prophet.

###### 1 
Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.

###### 2 
Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

###### 3 
And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.

###### 4 
Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.
