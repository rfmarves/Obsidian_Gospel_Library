__Summary__
1–6, The Saints must keep the gospel covenant to gain mercy; 7–10, They must be patient in tribulation.

---
###### 1 
Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world—

###### 2 
Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.

###### 3 
And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.

###### 4 
And as the covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect.

###### 5 
And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.

###### 6 
But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy.

###### 7 
Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.

###### 8 
And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.

###### 9 
And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.

###### 10 
And again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early shall find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
