1–4, Joseph and Sidney to preach the gospel for the salvation of souls; 5–8, It will be given them in the very hour what they should say; 9–12, Sidney is to be a spokesman and Joseph is to be a revelator and mighty in testimony; 13–17, The Lord will raise up a pure people, and the obedient will be saved.

###### 1 
Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.

###### 2 
Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you.

###### 3 
Behold, and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round about; and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern land.

###### 4 
Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.

###### 5 
Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;

###### 6 
For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.

###### 7 
But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness, in all things.

###### 8 
And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye shall say.

###### 9 
And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman unto this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.

###### 10 
And I will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.

###### 11 
And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures, that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on the earth.

###### 12 
Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end.

###### 13 
And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion. Zion shall be redeemed, although she is chastened for a little season.

###### 14 
Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands; and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.

###### 15 
Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church.

###### 16 
For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness;

###### 17 
And all that call upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments, shall be saved. Even so. Amen.
