__Summary__
1–3, The Apocrypha is mostly translated correctly but contains many interpolations by the hands of men that are not true; 4–6, It benefits those enlightened by the Spirit.

###### 1 
Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha—There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;

###### 2 
There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.

###### 3 
Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.

###### 4 
Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;

###### 5 
And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;

###### 6 
And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
