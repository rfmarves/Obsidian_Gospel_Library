###### 1 
My son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;

###### 2 
The light and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

###### 3 
Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;

###### 4 
And blessed are you because you have believed;

###### 5 
And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel—

###### 6 
To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming.

###### 7 
For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.

###### 8 
And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.

###### 9 
But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.

###### 10 
Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.

###### 11 
And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come—

###### 12 
And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.
