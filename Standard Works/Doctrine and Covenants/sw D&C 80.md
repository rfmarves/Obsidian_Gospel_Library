__Summary__
1â€“5, Stephen Burnett and Eden Smith are called to preach in whatever place they choose.

---
###### 1 
Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.

###### 2 
And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.

###### 3 
Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.

###### 4 
Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and know to be true.

###### 5 
Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
