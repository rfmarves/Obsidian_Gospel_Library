> __Summary__
1–3, Warren A. Cowdery is called as a local presiding officer; 4–5, The Second Coming will not overtake the children of light as a thief; 6–8, Great blessings follow faithful service in the Church.

###### 1 
It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and the regions round about;

###### 2 
And should preach my everlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties;

###### 3 
And devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give unto him, seeking diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for the laborer is worthy of his hire.

###### 4 
And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night—

###### 5 
Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light, and that day shall not overtake you as a thief.

###### 6 
And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in heaven when my servant Warren bowed to my scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of men;

###### 7 
Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him; and, notwithstanding the vanity of his heart, I will lift him up inasmuch as he will humble himself before me.

###### 8 
And I will give him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church I have prepared a crown for him in the mansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.
